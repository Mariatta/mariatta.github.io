Perhaps you never gave a talk before, and unsure if speaking for you? Perhaps you want to give a talk, but don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re experienced enough? Perhaps you have a talk idea, but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to turn it into a proposal?

But do you know what PEPs really are? PEPs are more than just a style guide. A PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It&amp;rsquo;s a proposal documentation for when you want to change the Python programming language in a big way, for example when you want to change the syntax of Python. Think of the addition of f-strings, the walrus operator, or the ExceptionGroup, those changes all started with a PEP.</description></item><item><title>There's an API for That!</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/theres-an-api-for-that/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/theres-an-api-for-that/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s an API For That!

But how do these things work? In this talk, we will cover the benefits of writing unit tests and how to get started with it in Python. Then, we&amp;rsquo;ll step it up running tests as part CI. And that&amp;rsquo;s not all! CI is not just about running tests, but for other things as well, like code quality checks, and even building and generating documentation.</description></item><item><title>Typo of the Day: Oofsite 😓</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/typo_of_the_day/oofsite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 17:02:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/typo_of_the_day/oofsite/</guid><description>Typo of the day: oofsite 😓#TypoOfTheDay

In this talk, I will share my journey and the things I’ve learned along the way, and some advice for other aspiring open source maintainers and contributors.</description></item><item><title>Typo of the Day: Hackmad</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/typo_of_the_day/hackmad/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2021 14:55:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/typo_of_the_day/hackmad/</guid><description>Typo of the day: HackMad (instead of HackMD)

I joined so many virtual conferences, and at one point, I was a speaker at three different conferences all in one same weekend.
2020 was also, a challenging time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to go out a lot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to do my Ice cream selfie after the conference.
Finally, on new year&amp;rsquo;s eve, we decided to celebrate and go out. While in Robson Street, we stopped by a Korean grocery store and my kids saw some boba milk tea ice cream bar for sale.</description></item><item><title>Typo of the Day: Git Geekout ...</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/typo_of_the_day/gitgeekout/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 18:16:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/typo_of_the_day/gitgeekout/</guid><description>Typo of the day: git geekout ...
