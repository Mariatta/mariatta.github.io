It is so unique so I decided to get my ice cream there.

I gave a talk, a tutorial, and also ran the first Mentored Sprints with Nina Zakharenko and Tania Allard, AND co-chaired the Python Language Summit for the first time 😵 (I ended up co-charing it for 4 years).
I went to Cathy&amp;rsquo;s Gourmet Ice Cream Sandwiches. The ice cream sandwich was really yummy! 😋
I&amp;rsquo;m sad to hear that this place has since closed down.</description></item></channel></rss>
