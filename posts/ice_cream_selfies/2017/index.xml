It was freezing cold outside, but didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from getting ice cream. I found La Cabane De Danny, and they make ice cream with bubble waffle cone. So fun! The matcha ice cream was real good!
Unfortunately this shop has since closed down.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCon AU 2017</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconau_2017/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2017 16:02:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconau_2017/</guid><description>Milkcow Australia I realized that this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve used the #IceCreamSelfie hashtag!!

My friend Jeff asked if there&amp;rsquo;s anything that would make me feel better, and I said &amp;ldquo;I wanna go get ice cream&amp;rdquo;. So we went to this place that he knew about.
At that time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider Ice Cream Selfie to be a &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; yet, but I think this is when it becomes a real &amp;ldquo;tradition&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ DjangoCon Europe, PyCon Italy 2017</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconit_djangoconeu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2017 16:02:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconit_djangoconeu/</guid><description>Hero image photo by Bartek Pawlik, DjangoCon Europe.
Icy Dot Wine I was just walking around in Florence, having given my talk at two conferences in the same week: PyCon Italy and DjangoCon Europe 2017.
At that time, Ice cream selfie isn&amp;rsquo;t quite a ritual yet, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know which shop this was.
After many years, I tracked down the shop name! This was from Icy Dot Wine.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCaribbean 2017</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pycaribbean/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:02:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pycaribbean/</guid><description>Puerto Rico Kim Crayton and I went to Condado Beach prior to the conference.
