Thanks North Bay Python for inviting me! I get to immortalize it in my ice cream selfie üòù
Little did I know that I would return to the conference, and back to Angela&amp;rsquo;s Organic Ice Cream five years later!</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ DjangoCon US 2018</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2018/djangoconus_2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2018 17:07:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2018/djangoconus_2018/</guid><description>Hammond&amp;rsquo;s Gourmet Ice Cream It was fun visiting San Diego for DjangoCon US 2018. I gave my talk Don&amp;rsquo;t Be a Robot; Build the Bot. I think it was well received üòä
This was also a special travel trip, because, well it happens that my husband also needed to travel for work at the same time, so we don&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to look after our two kids. I ended up taking my kids with me to the conference.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCon US 2018</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2018/pyconus_2018/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 May 2018 19:56:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2018/pyconus_2018/</guid><description>Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s Ice Cream At PyCon US 2018, I gave my talk What is a Python Core Developer.
It was emotionally difficult to give that talk ü•≤
I went to Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s HomeMade Ice cream to celebrate.
