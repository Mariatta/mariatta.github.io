This was an online event, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually go to Thailand for this. However, I found an ice cream flavour that represent Thailand: Thai Coconut Milk Gelato from Bella Gelateria!
Bella Gelateria has one of the best ice cream in Vancouver, they&amp;rsquo;ve won many awards!

It was an online event, so I looked for local ice cream shops where I live.
Snowy Village is my kids favorite place here. They really love the bingsu, which is milk-based Korean shaved ice dessert.
Bingsu counts as ice cream! #IceCreamSelfie 🍦😝🤳 @ Snowy Village pic.twitter.com/ZKqlTZkZUK

I&amp;rsquo;m glad they all obliged! 😊
I had the Nestle DRUMSTICK Sundae Cone.
