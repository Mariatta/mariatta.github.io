But do you know what PEPs really are? PEPs are more than just a style guide. A PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It&amp;rsquo;s a proposal documentation for when you want to change the Python programming language in a big way, for example when you want to change the syntax of Python. Think of the addition of f-strings, the walrus operator, or the ExceptionGroup, those changes all started with a PEP.</description></item><item><title>There's an API for That!</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/theres-an-api-for-that/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/theres-an-api-for-that/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s an API For That!

And that&amp;rsquo;s not all! CI is not just about running tests, but for other things as well, like code quality checks, and even building and generating documentation.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCon Colombia 2022</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2022/pyconcolombia_2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 13:17:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2022/pyconcolombia_2022/</guid><description>Cows Ice Cream Whistler I gave a keynote speech at PyCon Colombia.

Snowy Village is my kids favorite place here. They really love the bingsu, which is milk-based Korean shaved ice dessert.

2020 was also, a challenging time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to go out a lot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to do my Ice cream selfie after the conference.
Finally, on new year&amp;rsquo;s eve, we decided to celebrate and go out. While in Robson Street, we stopped by a Korean grocery store and my kids saw some boba milk tea ice cream bar for sale.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCon Australia, and PyCon Taiwan 2020</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pyconau-pycontw/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2020 20:44:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pyconau-pycontw/</guid><description>Rocky Point Ice Cream 2020, the year of virtual conferences for me.

Various mentors have helped me navigate the open source community and help advanced my skills. I realized finding a mentor is not as easy as it seems, and it takes a lot of courage to reach out in the first place. And then, there is impostor syndrome, where one may feel like they don&amp;rsquo;t deserve the help.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ DjangoCon Europe, PyCon Italy 2017</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconit_djangoconeu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2017 16:02:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconit_djangoconeu/</guid><description>Hero image photo by Bartek Pawlik, DjangoCon Europe.
