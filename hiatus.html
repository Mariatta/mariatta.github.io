  <div>
    <p>For the whole month of April, I made a personal goal to take a break from
participating in open source and the community.</p>
<p>First of all, thank you to everyone who gave me lots of moral support about this!</p>
<p>I felt kind of guilty at first. I was worried if my non-activity would mean
that other Python core devs will have to pick up the slack.</p>
<p>But let's give more credit to the core devs! Python has flourished for 20+ years
without my involvement. One month without me is fine.</p>
<div class="section" id="i-still-did-some-volunteering">
<h2><strong>I still did some volunteering</strong> üò•</h2>
<p>Some of these I sort of anticipated, many were unexpected.</p>
<p><strong>Released cherry_picker v1.1.0</strong></p>
<p>I had offered to help Andrew Svetlov with building a GitHub bot similar to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington">miss-islington</a>, but for maintaining
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp">aiohttp</a>. Part of the work
needed to be done is to make cherry_picker customizable for other projects.
Andrew had made the necessary code changes, but there was one small bug.
All I needed to do was <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/pull/233">review the PR</a>,
approve it, and publish the fix to PyPI. It didn't take
too much of my time, so I was quite happy to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Shadowed Larry and Barry</strong></p>
<p>This might sound cryptic, but I'll leave it at that for now. I'm also not quite
sure how it came to be, but this was something the BDFL asked me
to do. Who am I to say no?</p>
<p><strong>Organized a PyLadies Vancouver meetup</strong></p>
<p>I was hoping my co-organizers could take care of this for me, and I wished I
didn't have to be involved. But we were having trouble finding a sponsor who would
host our April meetup. (I will rant about this in detail some other time).</p>
<p>We reached out to at least five companies, and even tried booking a free meeting room
at Vancouver Public Library. Our requests were either denied or ignored.</p>
<p>I asked other meetup organizers and several Python friends in town for help. In
the end, we pushed the event to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/events/249657234/">May</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/CiscoSecurity">Cisco</a> stepped up to host.</p>
<p><strong>Got myself invited to yet another community Slack channel</strong></p>
<p>Related to our difficulty with finding a meetup venue, the experience
prompted me to reach out to the other meetup organizers in town. One group
I talked to called themselves the Gastown Gang. Previously, they had lured me in with
promises of pasta. üçùüòã</p>
<p>No pasta yet, but we had been talking about a new initiative for shared
resources among the local meetup communities in Vancouver,
how things can be more transparent and open, and how the different communities
can help and support each other. Somehow this ended with me joining a new community
Slack team. üòõ</p>
<p><strong>Volunteered to write the docs for PEP 557: Data Classes</strong></p>
<p>I had <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue32216">volunteered</a> to do it a couple
months ago, but never got around doing anything. After a gentle ping from an
eager member of the community, I emailed Eric and Raymond to see if we could
sprint on this at PyCon.</p>
<p><strong>I engaged with the community, on Twitter</strong></p>
<p>Ok maybe <em>engaged</em> was not the right word. More like, ... <em>provoked</em>?</p>
<p>I expressed my <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/987450414298685440">extreme disappointment</a>
to the community. I knew the risks and the repercussions for speaking up about
diversity issues. But I did it anyway.</p>
<p>And then the twitter broke. I mean, the twitter <em>on my phone</em> broke.</p>
<p>After having to block three people, I deleted the app for the rest of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Read up about PEP 572</strong></p>
<p>Several Python core devs told me about this PEP, so I read some of
the python-dev emails about it. <em>Keeping personal opinions to myself</em>. ü§ê</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-really-did-take-time-off">
<h2><strong>I really DID take time off!</strong></h2>
<p>Other than Andrew's PR, I didn't review any other pull requests.</p>
<p>Did not read any mailing list emails, except that one thread about PEP 572.</p>
<p>Did not follow any issues in the bug tracker, except for <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue3692">bpo-3692</a>. But that was raised at work, so I don't
consider it as volunteering.</p>
<p>I read Twitter only for my own notifications, mentions, and direct messages,
up until the weekend where my twitter broke.</p>
<p>What did I do for my own me time?</p>
<p><strong>Put in extra effort for my work at Zapier</strong></p>
<p>I got a couple new features shipped! üåÆ They're documented
<a class="reference external" href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/partner-api/#paging-through-results-using-limit-and-offset">here</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/shared-zaps-test-trigger/#embed-widget-faq">there</a>. üòÑ
I'm working on a new feature, wanted by several partners. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Netflix and ...</strong></p>
<p>ü§≠ Eh, ... I watched a lot of shows on Netflix: All 3 seasons of Hannibal, Lucky
Number Slevin, and Troy: Fall of a City.</p>
<p><strong>Played Ramen Sensei on my phone</strong> üçú</p>
<p>I'm still under the delusion that I can successfully run a ramen shop if I ever
need to leave tech.</p>
<p><strong>Went to my oldest son's first piano recital</strong> üéπ</p>
<p>He did great! üòä</p>
<p><strong>Worked on my GitHub Bot tutorial</strong></p>
<p>I spent two weekend afternoons to work on the tutorial. While I open-sourced
the  material, I don't count this as a <em>volunteer</em> work since I'll be getting paid
for it at PyCon. Thanks to Brett who reviewed it.</p>
<p><strong>Investigated if we could get a pet turtle</strong></p>
<p>Let's not tell my kids about this. After one afternoon of reading how to care
for a pet turtle, I realized I don't really want additional responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Watched My Little Pony</strong></p>
<p>My kids are into My Little Pony these days. Not something I'm familiar with. I'm
still learning all the ponies' name.</p>
<p><strong>Did my taxes</strong></p>
<p>Procrastinated doing it until pretty much the final day.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stuff-i-wanted-to-do-but-didn-t">
<h2><strong>Stuff I wanted to do, but didn't</strong></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I had been working on a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/pull/3306">pull request for Warehouse</a>. I was planning
to find some time to finish it up, but didn't. üò•</li>
<li>I've been wanting to do at least some kind of cooking, baking, try out new recipe,
or at least make a batch of handmade noodles. None of that happened. üòï</li>
<li>My review was requested for a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/pull/238">bugfix PR</a>
to cherry_picker. I still haven't looked at it. üòî</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="happiness">
<h2><strong>Happiness</strong></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I received a happiness packet. Thanks Anna. üíñ</li>
<li>Met up with my friends <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/986368161690759168">Seb and Dan</a>.
We chatted about the community, about PyCon, and, of course, about how awesome f-strings are.
I also got Dan to <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/986360574450651136">autograph</a> my copy of his
book! ü§©</li>
<li>Received compliments about miss-islington and my GitHub Bot tutorial.
Thanks <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/nicoddemus/status/980963184189329408">Bruno</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/webology/status/985167199043235842">Jeff</a>. üòä</li>
<li>Found out that my tutorial at PyCon is now full! üò≥Ô∏è</li>
<li>Thankful for the supportive Python community. üíñ</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-now">
<h2><strong>What now</strong></h2>
<p>I miss getting involved in open source, and being part of the community. But I
have other priorities for the moment.</p>
<p>I'm still wanting a break from contributing to open source for another month,
except when I'm at PyCon for the sprints.</p>
<p>I will however, start getting involved in my local Python community again.
I need to follow up with Gastown Gang, and start planning the next PyLadies Vancouver
meetups.</p>
<p>I'm so looking forward to PyCon! Can't wait for my next ice cream selfie!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="things-to-improve">
<h2><strong>Things to improve</strong></h2>
<p>The past month still felt busier than I wanted to. I'm still thinking up better
ways to do this. üò•</p>
<p><strong>Better Gmail filters</strong></p>
<p>I needed to adjust the email filters several times to get it right. I think
it is still not optimal. Some emails from GitHub and b.p.o were still going through.</p>
<p>Some important emails got missed, because the sender uses an email system that always
include the word &quot;unsubscribe&quot;. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
<p><strong>Delete twitter on my phone</strong></p>
<p>I should have done it from the get go. I should not even bother with
checking my mentions or direct messages. It got me into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>O-O-OS autoreply GitHub bot</strong></p>
<p>I was thinking it might be cool to have my own out-of-open source autoreply GitHub
bot. For example if someone mentions me or requested review from me, the bot can
respond on my behalf and let people know that I won't get to it for a while,
so they can find someone else. But I'm worried it'll just add noise to the thread.
More design is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Choose a different month</strong></p>
<p>I'll definitely do this again next year. Question is, which month? üòÖ</p>
<p>I'm learning now that the months before and during PyCon are busy times of the year for
a Python core developer. Same as any month where there's a scheduled release it seems.</p>
<p>Will it be so irresponsible if I choose to be off during those  months?
And do I need to co-ordinate with other core devs so we don't all go on a
break at the same time?</p>
<p><em>Why is this so complicated?</em> üôÉ</p>
