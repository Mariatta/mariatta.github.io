<h2>PyCascades</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Entering the last two weeks before the conference. Lots of little details still being sorted out.</li>
<li>Worked on the <a class="reference external" href="https://pycascades-welcome-wagon-2019.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">welcome wagon</a>.
Lots of updates to the travel guide and dining guide.</li>
<li>Considered using a different theme than alabaster for the welcome wagon. There's
a PR with a new theme, and it's looking great. But I felt somewhat uncomfortable
to switch to another theme that doesn't support Read The Docs' ethical advertisement.
I recommended PyCascades to support RTD some other way if we're going to not
use the theme anymore.</li>
<li>The entire team has continued to working tirelessly. Being a remote organizer,
sometimes I feel like I'm just the &quot;Chief Nagging Officer&quot;, keep asking them about
things, and not actually able to do anything. So all I can do is cheer.</li>
<li>We finally secured a sprint venue. I updated the welcome wagon with
<a class="reference external" href="https://pycascades-welcome-wagon-2019.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sprint.html">sprint info</a>,
and added <a class="reference external" href="https://ti.to/pycascades/pycascades-2019/with/senvon2fuek">registration ticket</a>.</li>
<li>Huddled with the CoC committee.</li>
<li>An attendee raised a concern about our venue accessibility. Discussed with Maelle
and Thea. We updated the Accessibility page with a <a class="reference external" href="https://2019.pycascades.com/accessibility/">fragrance free consideration</a> section.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="core-python-workflow">
<h2>Core Python Workflow</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ned Deily pinged me about an issue with bedevere's &quot;check News&quot; status. It wasn't
working the way we liked, and was blocking a PR from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/11779#issuecomment-462498706">getting merged</a>.
So I made a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/pull/152">PR to quickly fix it</a>.</li>
<li>While working on that issue, I realized that the GitHub bots have not been tested
against the latest Python versions, due to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/9069">known issue in Travis CI</a>.
We have been testing against Python 3.7.0a4, and we weren't even testing against
Python 3.8. So I went ahead and adjusted the travis configuration files and made
sure they're tested against 3.7.2 and 3.8.0. If you're curious,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/blob/5bb398ed02be63b461551fdfe365eb9e090053a3/.travis.yml">here's an example of how to configure Travis CI to test against the latest Python versions</a>.</li>
<li>One thing lead to another. Now tests are passing in Python 3.7.2 but failing in
3.8.0. We're not sure if the regression is with <tt class="docutils literal">aiohttp</tt> (3rd party library)
or <tt class="docutils literal">asyncio</tt> (Core Python). Currently waiting for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3606">Andrew to investigate</a>.</li>
<li>Asked in Python committers on how to proceed with <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/what-are-next-steps-for-pep-581/">PEP 581</a>.</li>
<li>Merged several PRs.</li>
<li>Set up netlify to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/devguide/issues/463">preview pull requests in Devguide</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pycon">
<h2>PyCon</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Got news that my talk has been accepted! Happy to reprise my talk, &quot;Don't Be a
Robot; Build the Bot&quot;.</li>
<li>Booked my flights and hotel. I'm going to arrive on Monday, April 29 (11 PM or
so). I'm hoping that'll give me to adjust to jet lag (yeah I know.. I'm old)
and a lot of time in case I need to chat with Łukasz about the language summit,
or with Andrew about our tutorial.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mentored-sprint-at-pycon">
<h2>Mentored Sprint at PyCon</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/">Mentored Sprint at PyCon</a>
was announced last weekend. Thank you Tania, Nina,
and Nikoleta for working together and including me into this effort.</li>
<li>Sign up forms are now live. Now it's time to start promote the event and get more
signups. I've <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/action-needed-participate-in-mentored-sprint-at-pycon-us/868">posted to Python core developers</a>
that I would like for them to sign up and mentor. Thank you core developers for
committing to mentor!</li>
<li>At the moment, we have a number of contributors signing up, but no projects other
than core Python has signed up yet. Our team are now discussing strategies to
promote and reach out to more audience.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="etc">
<h2>etc.</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Baked brownies for kids' Valentine day school party</li>
<li>Schools were closed because of the snow! Not a big deal since I work from home.
So I have two little &quot;interns&quot; working with me.</li>
<li>Wrote a really large check to pay for my own self-employed income tax to CRA.
Feels good to be able to do it!</li>
<li>A fun topic arised in PyLadies Slack, about debugging with 1/0 in Python. This
is something I learned from Ned Batchelder's talk, <a class="reference external" href="https://nedbatchelder.com/text/machete.html">Machete-Mode Debugging</a>.
Sometimes you just want to test and debug, and see if your code is running and
reached the part that you want it to reach. There are several ways to do this.
You can <tt class="docutils literal">raise Exception</tt>, you can add things like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print(&quot;here</span> it is&quot;)</tt>, you can
write a unittest, you can even write to log file. But those aren't as simple as
typing out mere 3 characters: <tt class="docutils literal">1/0</tt>. This for sure will cause your program to
stop (because nobody ever really tries to catch the <tt class="docutils literal">ZeroDivisionError</tt>) and bonus,
you get full stack trace. Now you're debugging! Of course NSFP: Not Safe for
Production 😛).</li>
<li>Last month, a kind Pythonista (who had read my <a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/interview-mariatta-wijaya/">interview in RealPython</a>) sent me
paypal payment, for me to spend it on ice cream. I've just gotten around buying
a tub of Matcha Ice cream from T&amp;T Supermarket. I haven't had this in a long
while! It's so good! 😋</li>
