[{"categories":null,"contents":"Speak at PyLadiesCon PyLadiesCon CFP is now open until September 15, 2024, and I would love to support you in submitting your talk.\nPerhaps you never gave a talk before, and unsure if speaking for you? Perhaps you want to give a talk, but don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;re experienced enough? Perhaps you have a talk idea, but don\u0026rsquo;t know how to turn it into a proposal? Perhaps you tried submitting talks before, but always get rejected and feeling discouraged? I\u0026rsquo;ve been through all of the above before myself, and I know how you feel. Having a supportive community, and having mentors who were willing to give personalized 1:1 feedback, have helped me overcome my fears and self-doubt, and be a better speaker. The PyLadies community is here to support you.\nWhile I can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that your talk will get accepted, I can support, offer advice/feedback, and cheer you in your public speaking journey.\nBook a time with me If you\u0026rsquo;re a PyLadies member (from anywhere), or you identify as a PyLady, and you\u0026rsquo;d like some support with your proposal, then you\u0026rsquo;re invited to book a time with me using this link: https://calendly.com/mariatta_/30-mins-chat.\nFor now until September 15, I\u0026rsquo;m opening up my weekends in my booking link above in case weekends work better for you.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t find a good meeting time using the link above, please contact me via email, and we\u0026rsquo;ll work something out: mariatta at pyladies dot com.\nHow you can support other PyLadies If you\u0026rsquo;re an experienced speaker and want to see more PyLadies speaking at conferences, I encourage you to offer your mentorship to the PyLadies that you know. Often, such help and advice are better received if coming from someone they already know, like yourself, instead of from a stranger like me.\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s hard for us to ask for help, and we don\u0026rsquo;t always know who can we ask for help from. By being explicit and letting others know that you\u0026rsquo;re available to help, it will lower that barrier.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re also offering your own speaker mentorship/speaker support sessions, let me know (via Mastodon), and I\u0026rsquo;ll update this post with link to yours.\nIf you know of PyLadies in your community who have done interesting work with Python but are not yet a public speaker, contact them and encourage them to start their public speaking journey, and let them know about this speaking opportunity. Check the PyLadiesCon CFP Outreach Kit to learn more on our outreach tips.\nYou can also help by spreading news about the conference by sharing on social media, talk about it on your next meetup/company meeting/newsletter/short videos, by sponsoring the event, or by volunteering.\nOther useful resources Video on how to submit your talk to PyLadiesCon My talks, with the actual proposal and abstract used to submit to the CFP. How to be a speaker by Cheuk. Share with me your favorite resources on public speaking (via Mastodon), and I\u0026rsquo;ll add yours to the list.\nAbout PyLadiesCon PyLadiesCon is an online conference for the global PyLadies community.

PEPs are more than just a style guide. A PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It\u0026rsquo;s a proposal documentation for when you want to change the Python programming language in a big way, for example when you want to change the syntax of Python. Think of the addition of f-strings, the walrus operator, or the ExceptionGroup, those changes all started with a PEP.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a PEP talk, where you can learn about the PEP process, what needs a PEP and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and how you as community members can take part.\nContact me (links below) if you\u0026rsquo;d like to hear this talk at your event.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Mariatta Wijaya (@mariatta81)\nPresented At North Bay Python 2023 PyGotham 2023 Videos North Bay Python 2023 Slide Deck Intended Audience This is aimed for newcomers and beginners of Python, who may have only heard of PEP 8 and not so much of other PEPs. I will cover what PEPs really are, the purpose, examples of PEPs, and how community member can participate if they want to.\nTalk Outline What\u0026rsquo;s a PEP (\u0026lt; 5 minutes)\nYou know of PEP 8 But there are other PEPs A PEP is a proposal: it\u0026rsquo;s a documentation for changes to Python What kind of Changes Need a PEP? (5 minutes)\nIf you want to add new syntax Example: f-strings, ExceptionGroup, the \u0026ldquo;walrus\u0026rdquo; operator Other things that have a PEP (5 minutes)\nRelease schedule Governance Informational (Style Guide) PEP lifecycle (10 minutes)\nHow it works: start with discussing it in a public forum (like Discourse or the Python Language Summit) If there is consensus and agreement of the idea, then a PEP will need to be written Steering Council review and approve (or reject) the PEP Once approved, the feature can go to the next Python release After the feature has been done: PEP becomes final. But PEP is not a documentation: you should read the Python docs after PEP has become final All of these can take months, even years Your role (5 minutes)\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t agree with a proposal (if it cause you hardship in the way you use Python), the best way to voice your concern is during PEP discussion period, before the SC approval, and before the release of Python. Sometimes new feature cause breakage, do test your codebase against the Python main branch, or alpha versions. Keep up to date by following the Discourse forum, or the PEPs repo ","date":"July 29, 2023","hero":"/images/posts/nbpy2023.jpeg","permalink":"https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/pep_talk/","summary":"Talk Abstract If you use Python, chances are you\u0026rsquo;ve heard of PEP 8, the Python style guide.\nBut do you know what PEPs really are?

Pretty soon I found myself being given commit rights to other people’s open source projects. Being a new open source maintainer brings a set of unique challenges that I was not fully prepared for. In this talk, I will share my journey and the things I’ve learned along the way, and some advice for other aspiring open source maintainers and contributors.","tags":["Public Speaking","Talks","Python","Community","Open Source"],"title":"Oops!
