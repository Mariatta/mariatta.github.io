[{"categories":null,"contents":"PyLadiesCon Certificate of Attendance Not sure how common is this practice of giving out certificates to conference attendees. I\u0026rsquo;ve been attending mostly Python-related conferences in North America, and we don\u0026rsquo;t usually get any certificates here. However, when I went to Python Brasil in Manaus 2022, they gave me a certificate of attendance. And as a conference organizer, occasionally I\u0026rsquo;d receive request from a few attendees and volunteers about such certificate, saying that their employer or school requires it as proof of attendance.\nSince PyLadiesCon is a global event with participation from all over the world, our team decided to send out certificates to all attendees, and not only to those who asked for it.\nWe also think that such a certificate could be a nice token of appreciation for the attendees, especially since we don\u0026rsquo;t currently give out swag.\nWith more than 700 registered attendees, it\u0026rsquo;s not feasible to create these certificates one by one. But thankfully, we\u0026rsquo;re also Python developers, so of course we write the code for doing it.\nEvent organizers, take note! Let me show you how to automatically generate certificates and send them via email to your event attendees using Python.\nTools we used Here are the different tools we used for this project:\nPretix Pretix is our ticketing platform. We use the API to retrieve the list of attendees, their names, and their email address.\nGoogle Slides We use Google Slides to create a template for the certificate. The idea is to simply update the name of the attendee on the certificate. Since Google Slides has an APIs that allows you to add text to presentation slides.\nGMail We need a way to send the certificate via email. We also want the email to be sent through the official PyLadiesCon email address instead of from my personal GMail address. Another complexity is that the PyLadies GMail account is a GSuite workspace account, so we need to use the GMail API to send the email. (eg we can\u0026rsquo;t use smtplib for it).\nGoogle Sheets We also want to send certificates to our volunteers and speakers, and we have been using Google Sheets to keep track of the list of our volunteers and speakers.\nGoogle Drive Google Drive is where we are store the certificate template. Since we will be copying/duplicating the template for each attendee, I needed a way to organize all of those into one folder. We will use Google Drive API later.\nPython I\u0026rsquo;m using Python 3.12.\nhttpx I use httpx for making HTTP requests to the Pretix API. This is just a personal preference. You can use the requests library if you prefer.\ngoogle-api-python-client This is the official Python client library for Google\u0026rsquo;s discover based APIs. We will use this library to interact with Google Sheets, Google Slides, and GMAIL APIs.\nDocs: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/docs/README.md\npython -m pip install -U google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib Preparations Create a Google Slide Template Before writing the code, first we need to come up with a template for the certificate. PyLadiesCon certificate template is private, however, I\u0026rsquo;ve created this sample certificate Google Slide template that you can use. Make a copy of it, or come up with your own template.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the important part about the template: You need to have a placeholder text, which will be replaced with the attendee\u0026rsquo;s name. Make sure the placeholder text is a unique string that can be easily searched and replaced. You may want to use some symbols to make it unique, basically some kind of text that you know will not appear in the certificate text.\nIf you look at the sample certificate template I created, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that I used texts like {{ blog-reader }} and {{ issue-date }} as the placeholder text. Feel free to have as many or as few placeholder text needed.\nPrepare a Google Sheets with the list of attendees and email address The Sheet should have at least two columns: the name and email address of the attendee. For PyLadiesCon, we have an additional column to indicate the role of the person, e.g. if they were a speaker, or a volunteer.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example spreadsheet that you can use for following along on this blog post.\nPrepare an email template to the attendee You may want to prepare an email template that you can use to send the certificate to the attendee. The email could include message like \u0026ldquo;Thank you for attending my event. Attached is your certificate of attendance.\u0026rdquo;.\nGet Pretix API Token You can get the API token from Pretix by going to your event dashboard \u0026gt; Teams \u0026gt; click on the team name.\nRead the docs about Pretix Token authorization.\nCreate a Google Cloud Project and Enable the APIs We need to enable certain APIs: Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Drive, and GMail.\nThis could be a bit tricky and time-consuming (and also confusing) the first time you do it. But, once you have created the project, and obtained the credentials, you can reuse it for other projects.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t get into detail on how to create the project and enable the APIs, as it\u0026rsquo;s already well documented in the Google Cloud docs.\nIf you go to each of the API docs for the above products, there are links and buttons for enabling the APIs. Go there, click the buttons, and follow through the steps.\nGoogle Sheets Python quickstart Google Slides Python quickstart GMail Python quickstart Google Drive Python quickstart Pseudocode For now, we just want to create and send certificates to event attendees.\nPseudocode for creating and sending certificates to attendees.\nGet the list of attendees from Pretix For each attendee: copy the certificate Google Slide template add the attendee name on the certificate download the certificate as PDF send the PDF certificate via email to the attendee Setting up Google APIs with Python client library Set up the code for working with the various Google APIs: GDrive, Google Sheets, GMail, and Google Slides.\n# import the necessary libraries import os from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials from google.auth.transport.requests import Request from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow from googleapiclient.discovery import build # These are the different scopes we need for the different Google APIs SCOPES = [ \u0026#34;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly\u0026#34; ] GSLIDES_TEMPLATE_ID = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Google Slide template ID.

Since the resource is paginated, I added a while loop there.\nclass PretixWrapper: ... def get_orders(self): has_response = True url = BASE_PRETIX_URL + f\u0026#34;organizers/{organizer_name}/events/{event_name}/orders/\u0026#34; index = 0 while has_response: response = httpx.get(url, headers=self.headers) url = response.json()[\u0026#34;next\u0026#34;] has_response = url is not None for r in response.json()[\u0026#34;results\u0026#34;]: index += 1 yield r Call the API:\nimport os # get the token from env variable # you can hardcode it too, but people always forget to remove it before committing PRETIX_TOKEN = os.getenv(\u0026#34;PRETIX_TOKEN\u0026#34;) # instantiate the pretix wrapper class pretix_wrapper = PretixWrapper(PRETIX_TOKEN) response = pretix_wrapper.get_orders() for order in response: # an order could have multiple items, eg if they purchase more than one ticket items = order[\u0026#34;positions\u0026#34;] payment_confirmed = False for payment in order[\u0026#34;payments\u0026#34;]: # we only want to send certificate to attendees who finished the ticketing process (not withdrawn, not cancelled) if payment[\u0026#34;state\u0026#34;] == \u0026#34;confirmed\u0026#34;: payment_confirmed = True if payment_confirmed: for item in items: # Depending on how you configure your ticket on pretix, you might get different fields returned. # Check the API response to see what fields are available to you attendee_name = item[\u0026#34;attendee_name\u0026#34;] order_id = item[\u0026#34;order\u0026#34;] position_id = item[\u0026#34;positionid\u0026#34;] email = item[\u0026#34;attendee_email\u0026#34;] I decided to keep track of the attendee\u0026rsquo;s order id and the position id, because I know that this is a unique identifier for each attendee. I use this later to determine whether the certificate for this person has been generated or not, so I don\u0026rsquo;t end up with duplicated certificate for the same person.\nCopy the Slide Template From the above code, I now have the attendee\u0026rsquo;s name. This is good enough information to begin copying the Google Slide template.\ndef copy_presentation(source_presentation_id, filename): body = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: filename} drive_response = ( gdrive_service.files().copy(fileId=source_presentation_id, body=body).execute() ) presentation_copy_id = drive_response.get(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) # the id of the newly created presentation return presentation_copy_id # Use the Pretix order id and position id as the filename for the certificate filename = f\u0026#34;{order_id}-{position_id}\u0026#34; new_slide_id = copy_presentation(GSLIDES_TEMPLATE_ID, filename) Update the Slide with the Attendee\u0026rsquo;s Name Now that the certificate template has been copied, we can update it with the attendee\u0026rsquo;s actual name. What we want to do now is to search for the placeholder text in the slide, and replace it with the attendee\u0026rsquo;s name.\nFirst, prepare the Google Slides request payload.\nIn my example Google Slides Template, My placeholder texts are: {{blog-reader-name}}, and {{issue-date}}.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll want to adjust the placeholder text and the payload below to match your own template. Below is an example for replacing the {{blog-reader-name}} placeholder with the attendee name, and the {{issue-date}} with today\u0026rsquo;s date.\nThe important part to look at is the \u0026quot;replaceAllText\u0026quot; key in the request payload. Basically, we\u0026rsquo;re telling Google to look for the specified placeholder text, and replace it with the new text. This is why you need to have a unique placeholder text and a text that doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear anywhere else in the slide. Using symbols like {{ }} could help with making it unique.\nfrom datetime import datetime requests = [ { \u0026#34;replaceAllText\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;containsText\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{{blog-reader-name}}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;matchCase\u0026#34;: True, }, \u0026#34;replaceText\u0026#34;: attendee_name, } }, { \u0026#34;replaceAllText\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;containsText\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{{issue-date}}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;matchCase\u0026#34;: True, }, \u0026#34;replaceText\u0026#34;: f\u0026#34;{datetime.now():%B-%d, %Y}\u0026#34;, } }, ] Call Google Slides API to update the slide, passing the above request payload.\nbody = {\u0026#34;requests\u0026#34;: requests} response = gslides_service.presentations().batchUpdate( presentationId=new_slide_id, body=body).execute() After this, you should see the certificate updated with the attendee name in Google Drive.\nDownload the Google Slide presentation as a PDF File Maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t want the attendee to know that their certificate was created using Google Slides, so you want to create PDF version of it.\nYou can download and export the Google slide as a PDF file using Python. GDrive API has the export method that you can call to do this.\nstream = gdrive_service.files().export(fileId=new_slide_id, mimeType=\u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34;).execute() with open(f\u0026#34;{filename}.pdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;wb\u0026#34;) as f: f.write(stream) After this, you should see the PDF file downloaded in the same directory as your script.\nSend the PDF Certificate using GMail Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to send the certificate to the attendee. Do you have the email message ready?\nI\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to send the email in both plain text and HTML format.\nfrom textwrap import dedent email_message_plain = dedent(f\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Dear {attendee_name}, Thanks for reading my blog post.

I would also add something like \u0026ldquo;TEST\u0026rdquo; to the subject line.\nOnce I\u0026rsquo;m confident that the email is being sent correctly, I then change it to the actual recipient\u0026rsquo;s email address and use the proper subject line.\nReading attendee list from Google Sheets What if you don\u0026rsquo;t use Pretix? No problem. As mentioned above, for PyLadiesCon, we also needed to send certificates to our volunteers and speakers, and this info wasn\u0026rsquo;t on Pretix.\nLet me show you how to read the list of names and email address from Google Sheets.\nI\u0026rsquo;m using my example spreadsheet which has only two columns, the name and email address.\nsheet = gsheets_service.spreadsheets() result = ( sheet.values() .get(spreadsheetId=GSHEETS_ID, range=\u0026#34;Certificate Recipients!A2:C200\u0026#34;) # adjust the range to match your sheet .execute() ) values = result.get(\u0026#34;values\u0026#34;, []) for row in values: attendee_name = row[0] attendee_email = row[1] The above code will read the list of names and email address from the Google Sheet, extracting their name and email address.\nYou can then use the same code as above to copy the Google Slide template, update the slide with the attendee\u0026rsquo;s name.\nThe complete script I\u0026rsquo;ve created a gist with the complete script that combines all the above code snippets.\nIf you want to see the actual code we used for PyLadiesCon, check it out at the pyladies/global-conference-infra repo: https://github.com/pyladies/global-conference-infra/blob/main/certificates2024/util.py\nConclusion Sending certificates of participation is a nice gesture to show your appreciation. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice token for saying thank you to your attendees, speakers, and volunteers, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost much to create. The certificate can be shown to their boss, employer, school, etc as proof that they participated in your event. If you are an event organizer, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend you look into generating these certificates to your attendees.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what Laura Funderburk, one of PyLadiesCon conference speakers, says about the certificate.\n","date":"December 12, 2024","hero":"/images/posts/pyladiescon-certificate-2024.png","permalink":"https://mariatta.ca/posts/create-send-certificates-with-python/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"pyladiescon-certificate-of-attendance\"\u003ePyLadiesCon Certificate of Attendance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot sure how common is this practice of giving out certificates to conference attendees.

I think depends on who you\u0026rsquo;re talking to, they might see it as an optional nice thing they could get/do, but the same thing might be seen as burden responsibility to others.\nHere are a list of all of the things I can get and do as a Python core developer, and I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it to you to decide whether you see it as a perk, privilege, or a responsibility.\nCommit access to CPython repository (and 20+ other Python repos) I see the green \u0026ldquo;Merge\u0026rdquo; button on the CPython GitHub repo. I can merge my PRs, and I can merge other people\u0026rsquo;s PRs.\nOf course, I don\u0026rsquo;t just merge randomly everything as I please. PRs still go through reviews. Other core devs can also reject my PRs, and they can revert any changes I make if they disagree. Though this hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet in my case.\nAnd of course I don\u0026rsquo;t commit malicious code.\nYes I can merge, but it is also something that we each have to do responsibly.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not just the CPython that I have commit access to. I also have write privileges to other related Python repositories like the devguide, peps, core-workflow, bedevere, etc.\nA python.org email address I have my own python dot org email address. I use it when people want to contact me for Python-related things. But I don\u0026rsquo;t use it for non-Python related things. Eg. when I apply for jobs, or when signing up for a food-delivery app account.\nAttend Python Language Summit at PyCon US As a Python core developer, I get to attend the Python Language Summit. Non Python core team members can apply and sign up for it too, but core developer gets first dibs to available space.\nNote that this is a change from before I started co-chairing the Language Summit in 2019. Prior to 2019, the summit was exclusively only for Python core developers. If you\u0026rsquo;re not a core developer, then you needed to first be invited by another core developer.\nIt was one of the things I took the initiative to change when I co-chaired the summit. Waiting to be invited, or becoming friend of a core dev, is such a narrow gate to participation. By allowing more people to sign up, it opens up the summit for more diverse voices and perspectives.\nSince 2019, non-core developers like triagers and maintainers of other relevant open source libraries have been participating and in the language summit, like the maintainers of Hypothesis, BeeWare, CircuitPython, etc.\nAccess to CPython \u0026ldquo;funds\u0026rdquo; As a Python core developer, I can apply for funds from the PSF for these things:\nPython Core Sprint Travel grant to PyCon US Free registration to PyCon US Note that even though PyCon US has its own travel grant fund, (and there\u0026rsquo;s also a separate fund from PyLadies at PyCon US), the funds for the Python core devs are separate from all those. i.e. I won\u0026rsquo;t be taking away funds from other attendees. Only from other core devs. And of course, the expectation is that if a core dev has employer who could pay for their travel, then they should be asking their employer first. But for me, most of the time, my employer aren\u0026rsquo;t funding my core Python activities, so yeah I\u0026rsquo;m one of the recipients of these \u0026ldquo;CPython funds\u0026rdquo;.\nThe fund comes from the PSF\u0026rsquo;s Sponsor income: \u0026ldquo;Core Development Benefits\u0026rdquo;. You can read more about CPython\u0026rsquo;s financials posted by Thomas Wouters on Discourse. I wish this is in more publicly visible place though, not buried under old Discourse topics.\nPython core sprints in which I was covered by the PSF instead of by employer:\n2017 (Bay Area, USA) 2018 (Redmond, USA) 2020 (online) 2021 (online) 2022 (Mountain View, USA) 2023 (Brno, Czech Republic) 2024 (Bellevue, USA) Now that I think of it, it\u0026rsquo;s basically all of them. The PSF covered the cost of my travel and hotel accommodation for the sprints. You can read in my sprint blog post to learn exactly what was covered for the Bellevue sprint (and how much). I\u0026rsquo;m sharing all of this for transparency.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t attend the sprint in 2019 because it conflicted with work event at the time.\nThere was no travel involved for the online sprints (2020 and 2021), but we did receive meal stipends from The PSF.\nPyCon US in which I applied for travel grants as a Python core developer:\n2017 2024 In 2015 and 2016 I received travel grant from the PyLadies PyCon US travel grant pool because I was not yet a core dev back then.\nIn 2018, 2019, my employer back then covered my travel.\n2020 and 2021 were online so no travel involved.\nIn 2022, my employer paid for my flight ticket, but my hotel was covered by The PSF because I was the conference co-chair.\nIn 2023, I was expecting my employer to cover my conference travel costs, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t. I only learned about it after the PyCon US travel grant application has closed. If I had learned about it sooner, I would have applied for the travel grant. However because I was also serving as conference chair for PyCon US, I wrote a message to PSF accounting team, and they covered everything for me.\nNominate people for Python triage privileges Becoming a Python Triager requires only one approval from Python core developer. As of now, I have nominated 6 people for Python triage privileges.\nNominate people for Python core privileges Becoming a Python core team member requires a vote from the existing Python core developers, and at least 2/3 positive vote.\nAs of now, I have nominated 2 people for Python core privileges.\nWrite a PEP without needing a sponsor As a Python core developer I can go ahead and write a PEP. So far I have authored 4 PEPs, including PEP 581: Using GitHub Issues for CPython.\nSponsor a PEP written by non-core developer Non-core devs can write a PEP too, but they need to have a core dev willing to sponsor it. So far I have sponsored 2 PEPs.\nAccess to private python/voters repository Most Python repositories are public and open source, but the python/voters GitHub repo is private and only accessible by Python core developers. This repo contains sensitive and private information that we use during Python steering council election.

I nominated myself for Steering Council terms 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2024. I have never been elected as an SC member.\nNominate others for Python Steering Council election Non-Python core devs can be nominated for Steering Council by any Python core developer.\nI have not nominated anyone else yet for Python steering council.\nVote in the Python Steering Council election Currently only Python core developers can vote in the annual Python Steering Council election.\nI have been voting in the Python Steering Council election since 2019.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also opened a discussion thread about expanding the voters pool for the Python Steering Council elections. If this sounds interesting to you, please participate in the discussion, or write to me privately.\nFree registration to EuroPython Since 2018, the EuroPython Society has been offering free EuroPython registrations to Python core developers. The fund is called the \u0026ldquo;Guido van Rossum Core Developer Grant\u0026rdquo;.\nI have never had the opportunity to attend EuroPython yet. Maybe one day.\nJetBrains PyCharm Professional License I\u0026rsquo;ve been using PyCharm IDE since the time I was still just learning to use Python, even before I moved to Vancouver, and long before I became a Python core developer.\nMy PyCharm License looks like this:\nPyCharm 2024.2.3 (Professional Edition) Build #PY-242.23339.19, built on September 25, 2024 Licensed to CPython development / Mariatta Wijaya Subscription is active until September 2, 2025. For non-commercial open source development only. Visual Studio subscription I don\u0026rsquo;t use VS, but I know this is available to Python core developers.\nGitHub Copilot GitHub Copilot is free for maintainers of popular open source projects. CPython is a popular open source project. So as a maintainer of Python, I get to use GitHub Copilot for free, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been integrating it with my PyCharm IDE.\nAccess to exclusive category and content on Python\u0026rsquo;s Discourse On Python Discourse forum, Python core developers get to write on the \u0026ldquo;Committers\u0026rdquo; category, and I get a Python badge next to my handle stating that I\u0026rsquo;m a Python core developer.\nAccess to exclusive channel on Core Developer Discord There is a Discord server for Python core developers, in which other contributors like triagers are also invited. As a core developer, I get access to an additional \u0026ldquo;committers\u0026rdquo; channel that is not available to other type of contributors.\nRespect Everyone\u0026rsquo;s always looking for ways to stand out in resumes, right? So do I. I\u0026rsquo;ve been an engineer for longer than I\u0026rsquo;ve been a core developer, and I do notice that having the extra title like open source maintainer and public speaker really make a difference. As a woman, as someone with foreign last name that nobody knows how to pronounce, as someone who looks foreign, and speaks in a foreign accent, having these extra \u0026ldquo;credentials\u0026rdquo; helped me be seen as more or less equal compared to other people.\nI also notice that people treat you differently when you have a title like \u0026ldquo;Python core developer\u0026rdquo;. Maybe it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean much to other core devs, but again, as myself, this title of \u0026ldquo;Python core developer\u0026rdquo; makes people treat you more seriously.\nOf course, I wish that things are different. I wish that people treat me the same way regardless of my title. But, this is reality.\nI also used to witness people making inappropriate racist/sexist jokes right in front of me, and then be told to \u0026ldquo;lighten up\u0026rdquo;, because \u0026ldquo;obviously\u0026rdquo; they were \u0026ldquo;just joking\u0026rdquo; and that I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too sensitive.\nWell, after being a Python core dev, I almost never have to deal with that kind of thing anymore. I do think people are more careful about what they say and do around me now. Maybe there were still some incidents, but at least now I know I can just report them to the CoC team and let them take it from there.\nEligibility for Django Software Foundation (DSF) Individual Membership Updated Oct 29, 2024\nIndividual Members are appointed by the DSF in recognition of their contribution to the DSF\u0026rsquo;s mission of advancing and promoting Django, protecting the framework\u0026rsquo;s long-term viability, and advancing the state of the art in web development.\nDSF membership comes with perks like recognitions for their contributions to the community.

There were a few interesting tickets related to the datetime module. These issues were discovered by Hypothesis, a property-based testing tool for Python. I\u0026rsquo;ve been hearing a lot about Hypothesis, but never really used it in production or at work. I watched a talk about it at PyCon US many years ago, and I even had ice cream selfie with Zac who maintains Hypothesis. Anyway, I\u0026rsquo;ve just been interested in learning more about Hypothesis and how it could solve issues not caught by other testing methods, and I think this is one of the perks of contributing to open source: getting exposed to things you don\u0026rsquo;t normally use at work, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s a great way to learn new things.\nThese were the three issues I looked at during the last day of the sprint:\ndatetime.strptime(dt.strftime(\u0026quot;%c\u0026quot;), \u0026ldquo;%c\u0026rdquo;)) fails when year is \u0026lt;1000 It seemed like this issue is related to the locale, and the operating system. The ticket says it is affecting Linux, so I tried it on my machine (macOS) and couldn\u0026rsquo;t replicate the issue. So hopefully, by sharing that it works on MacOS and not on Linux, it could help others to better diagnose it and to come up with a fix.\ndatetime.strftime strings can be terminated by \u0026ldquo;\\x00\u0026rdquo; literals If you pass in \\x00 (null-termination) to strftime, the parser treats it as \u0026ldquo;end of string\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; from datetime import dateteime \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; datetime(2024, 9, 25).strftime(\u0026#34;\\x00%Y-%m-%d\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;\u0026#34; In the above example, it simply prints an empty string and the rest of the format specifiers like %Y, %m, and %d were ignored.\nAs Paul said in the issue, I too would have expected it to print \u0026quot;\\x002024-09-25\u0026quot;, i.e. it should not have tried to parse other characters that are not datetime format specifiers. A PR for this has just been opened by Serhiy. (PR #124531)\ndatetime.strptime accepts incompatible arguments Currently, if you try to pass datetime format like %Y%y (both are for representing \u0026ldquo;year\u0026rdquo;), only the last format specifier gets applied. For example:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; from datetime import datetime \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; datetime.strptime(\u0026#34;200099\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;%Y%y\u0026#34;) datetime.datetime(1999, 1, 1, 0, 0) In the above example, the passed-in string contains two year-formats: 2000 and 99. However, only the resulting datetime object is 1999.\nI think this is a user error, they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t try to pass in two different year on the same datetime object. However, currently Python lets people do this without any warning. So in the ticket, Paul asked what we should do.\nIn my mind, at the very least we should document that only the last year format gets applied. But this also seems like inappropriate use of the function, so I think we should let user know when they\u0026rsquo;re trying to do something like this. So I\u0026rsquo;d recommend that we raise some kind of warning. What do you think? I\u0026rsquo;ve opened a PR to document it.\nModernizing Python Docs I mentioned in my earlier blog post about unpopular Python Docs idea. I asked if anyone wanted to hear it out.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s something that I mentioned briefly during my \u0026ldquo;Changelong\u0026rdquo; keynote at PyOhio 2024, that the Python Docs haven\u0026rsquo;t evolved much in the last 20 years. We\u0026rsquo;ve been using the same infrastructure and tooling for a long time. And I just think it\u0026rsquo;s time for a change, though at that time, I don\u0026rsquo;t quite know what is this \u0026ldquo;change\u0026rdquo; would even look like.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s my idea:\nPython docs are built using Sphinx and reStructuredText. Both tools are Python-centric tools. They work great. There really are things that Sphinx and reStructuredText can do that other tools can\u0026rsquo;t. But there are also things that other tools are great at, that the current tooling can\u0026rsquo;t do.\nIf I were to simply say, \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s update Python docs\u0026rdquo;, we\u0026rsquo;d probably be constrained to thinking about ideas and improvements based on what Sphinx/reStructuredText can do now. So I wanted to be thinking in a broader sense, and not be constrained by the current tooling. I wanted for us to think about what our documentation would look like, if we were to start from scratch today.\nI really like the docs from Astro (a documentation framework). I learned about Astro from Cristián Maureira-Fredes, who mentioned it during one of PyLadiesCon planning meetings. And, the night before, when chatting with Dave Peck and Jim Baker, I shared this idea with them, and Dave actually said that he also uses Astro for his own blog, and he highly recommends it.\nI just love Astro docs look like, and I really like the components like quiz and checklists in their tutorial to track the progress of the learner. That sort of interactivity is really cool.\nSo during the meeting at the sprint, with Hugo, Jelle, Petr, and Russell, I started by saying that I want Python docs to look more like what Astro docs look like, along with the interactive components, like quizzes and checklists. What can we do to go from what we have now, to there? I know it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a big change that takes time. I know it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a long-term project. So how can we make it one step closer to reality?\nThe group shared really good suggestions and insights.\nIf not Sphinx, then which tool do we use? Jumping from .rst to .md might be a bearable change, especially nowadays there are more documentation tool that support both Sphinx and Markdown, and there have been more third-party Python library that uses markdown for their docs.\nBut jumping from Python-based tool to JavaScript-based tool? You try saying this to 100+ Python core devs 😅 So what I need is a really strong case to show about what other tools can provide. And this is where I\u0026rsquo;m at.\nSome things were mentioned:\nDo some research to find the right tool. Is it Astro, or something else? What other tool can be used? Whatever tool we use, it better be something that we can use for a long time, i.e. not an obscure tool that might be abandoned in a few years. Maybe just the tutorials could be hosted separately and be made with these interactive elements, instead of re-doing the entire Python docs. I really like this idea! So maybe we should have something like official tutorials.python.org, an authoritative tutorials for Python.\nAt first, there was suggestion to just start such content as a third party, like on my personal repo, and if it gets traction, at that time I could propose to move it to the Python org.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think it is a good idea. There are already many Python tutorials written out there. You can even take Python tutorials from Udemy, Coursera, freecodecamp, etc. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be creating another one of those. Meanwhile, Python itself has a tutorial section in the docs already. This is the tutorial that really needs improvement. If the tutorials are to be written for Python, then it should belong in the Python repo from the get-go.\nAlso, I can\u0026rsquo;t be writing good tutorials myself, I don\u0026rsquo;t have the skills for that. The community would need to help and participate and contribute. I can\u0026rsquo;t do an outreach effort asking people to contribute when the repo is on my personal repo.\nI also want for anyone who contributes to this to be recognized as \u0026ldquo;core contributor\u0026rdquo; to Python, and not as a \u0026ldquo;community\u0026rdquo; contribution. So I\u0026rsquo;d like to see this effort to be an officially recognized activity by the core Python project, and therefore it should be hosted on the Python GitHub org.\nI will be discussing this idea further with the Python Docs WG and the Python Docs Editorial board after the sprint.\nPython Deprecation Workflow After Brett brought up about Python deprecation policy the day prior, I realized that I never really know the full story or workflow for deprecating Python features. The only thing I was aware of was that we need to keep the DeprecationWarning for 2 releases, but how does it really work? How do we remember to remove the feature two releases from now? What docs do we need to write? How do we tell users about the deprecation? How will users become aware of the deprecation?\nAdding new features are easy and fun, but removing and deprecating things are hard. When I read changelogs, I read the deprecation section first before the new features. So I just wanted to learn more of how this works in Python.\nI was also reviewing a ticket for deprecating argparse.FileType type converter. As part of reviewing the PR, I figured that I should make sure that the proper deprecation process is being followed, but first I must learn about what the \u0026lsquo;proper\u0026rsquo; process is.\nI asked on Discord to get some answers. Turns out, all we have right now is the \u0026ldquo;deprecation policy\u0026rdquo; in PEP 387: Backwards Compatibility Policy, which is just an overall policy documentation, but not really a \u0026ldquo;how-to\u0026rdquo; guide for deprecation.\nBased on answers from Discord, I\u0026rsquo;ve opened a devguide ticket to document the Deprecation Workflow.\nCore.py podcast recording The core.py podcast is one year old (it started after the last Python core sprint in Brno) and Meta prepared a birthday cake to celebrate.\nWe all got interviewed by Pablo and Łukasz for core.py podcast to share what we did at the sprint. The episode is already out. Listen to it to learn about what others at the sprint have been doing.\n(My part starts at around 33:00)\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Mariatta Wijaya (@mariatta81)\nPython conference t-shirts Python conference/Python-themed t-shirts worn by Python core devs today:\nPyCascades (Mariatta and Guido) PyCon US 2022 (Greg) PyCon US 2021 (Thomas) Dinner My family drove over to stay overnight on Friday.

My first ever Python core sprint in 2017 was also at Meta in the Bay Area, but the room was much smaller (they called it the \u0026ldquo;War Room\u0026rdquo;) for 20 people. The sprint venue this time is much more spacious and comfortable. I really love it. Meta not only provided the venue, but also served us breakfast and lunch daily, as well as a fancy dinner on Thursday at Anthony\u0026rsquo;s HomePort Kirkland.\nThank you to other Meta employees who also supported us during the sprint: Dino Viehland, Jason Fried, Matt Page, Parul Gupta, and Thomas Wouters.\nThank you The PSF for covering the cost of my trip! The PSF paid for my hotel stay during the sprint (6 nights, I think it was about $1500 USD). We also received per diem meal allowances each day, and I was also reimbursed for mileage because my family drove over to pick me up (approx 450 kms roundtrip).\nThank you to all the core team members and triagers who participated in the sprint! It\u0026rsquo;s nice being able to just chat in real life and getting to know more about each other. I appreciate all the work you do for Python.\nThank you to folks who wore Python-themed shirts during the sprint! Buying and wearing Python conference t-shirts are great ways to show your support to the community. At the sprint, we\u0026rsquo;ve seen t-shirts from: PyCon US, PyCascades, PyCon Charlas, EuroPython, PyBay, PyCon CZ, PyLadies, PyLadies CZ, PyJogja, Python Pizza, and Black. If you want to t-shirt-twin with any of us, you know what to do. Go attend a regional Python conference near you, and buy their t-shirt. Pro-tip: Guido owns at least 5 PyCascades t-shirt. If you want to know when are the regional Python conferences happening, go check out the Python conferences GitHub repo.\nThank you to my GitHub sponsors As a self-employed independent consultant, I can\u0026rsquo;t bill my client for time away at the sprint. Having GitHub sponsors helps me afford taking the take time off to do things like this. I really appreciate your continued support. If you\u0026rsquo;re not yet a sponsor, why not start now?\nThe sprint has always been a great experience for me. I came thinking that I\u0026rsquo;d just be working on some docs, but I left with learning a lot more, and feeling inspired with ideas of how to improve Python. I really wish I could have more time to do these things for the community.\nAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;m back home now and catching up on work and things before traveling again for another Python conference in a few weeks.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Mariatta Wijaya (@mariatta81)\nThank you for reading!\nRelated Contents Check out other great posts about the sprint:\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s report on dev.to\nBeeWare\u0026rsquo;s September status update\nCPython Core sprint was held at @meta Bellevue “Spring District” campus on the week of September 23rd, 2024.

Template strings? Has a name been decided yet?\nI chatted more with Dave Peck and Jim Baker about PEP 750, and they explained in more details about the use cases in DSL (Domain Specific Language), for SQL and HTMLs. Guido, Lysandros, Jim, and Dave all met today to further refine the PEP, and it sounds like they have a good plan for it. And a lot of people at the sprint also expressed their enthusiasm for this PEP. So look forward to the updated PEP!\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re new to Python, and wondering, \u0026ldquo;what the heck is a PEP?\u0026rdquo;, you can learn more about it by watching my \u0026ldquo;PEP Talk\u0026rdquo; from PyGotham 2022 and North Bay Python 2023. 5 years of Python Deprecation (instead of 2) Brett asked if the group is ok with updating the wording in PEP 387 to say 5 years of Python deprecation period instead of 2.\nCurrently, when deprecating anything in Python, we add a DeprecationWarning, and it has to be left there for 2 releases before we can actually remove the code.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s imagine we\u0026rsquo;re deprecating f-strings (added in Python 3.6). F-strings are popular feature and lots of people use it nowadays. But let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to remove it today, in the year 2024. The timeline for removing f-strings in 2024 would need to be like this:\nPython 3.6: f-strings added (2016) Python 3.11: add DeprecationWarning to f-strings (2022) Python 3.13: f-strings removed (2024) With the proposal, if we wanted to remove f-strings in 2024, the timeline would look more like:\nPython 3.6 f-strings added (2016) Python 3.8: add DeprecationWarning to f-strings (2019) Python 3.13: f-strings removed (2024) Don\u0026rsquo;t worry! We\u0026rsquo;re not removing f-strings! This is just for illustration purpose.\nOne of the reasoning for the proposed change is that most people aren\u0026rsquo;t using the newest Python version, but more\nlikely the ones that are almost EOL/in security fixes phase (which is 5-releases-ago Python). By keeping the deprecation warning for 5 years, it gives visibility of this warning to the users who are using the older Python.\nBrett also shared another example: in larger codebase and large group of developers, coordinating and implementing Python upgrade is a big undertaking, and takes a long time because of the size of the codebase. So they don\u0026rsquo;t always update their Python version once a year.\nAnd because they don\u0026rsquo;t update their Python version each year, when they do get to it, they skip versions. I.e, they don\u0026rsquo;t upgrade from Python 3.7 to 3.8 to 3.9 to 3.10, but they jump from something like 3.7 to 3.10.\nBecause of skipping versions like this, they would miss the DeprecationWarning that was added inbetween. By letting the deprecation warning to stay for 5 years, it gives people more time to see it and act on it.\nA Discourse post was later opened to further discuss this: Updating PEP 387 to prefer 5-year deprecations instead of 2 years\nCPython\u0026rsquo;s JIT Compiler Brandt Bucher gave a presentation about enabling CPython\u0026rsquo;s JIT Compiler. The JIT Compiler was first introduced during last year\u0026rsquo;s Python core sprint in Brno. Since then, he wrote PEP 744 and created the PR for it. (PR #113463).\nBrandt shared the stats and performance improvements from the JIT compiler, but this also comes with an additional build time LLVM dependency. There is a very large C header file generated at build time by LLVM, the jit_stencils.h file. This is basically a \u0026ldquo;human-readable\u0026rdquo; compiled extension module. This file is 1.2 MB large, but can be compressed to 670 KB when unformatted, or further down to 300 KB if uncommented.\nThe question becomes, do we want to include this file as part of CPython repository, or host it elsewhere.\nHosting it elsewhere means people need internet access to build CPython, which is not ideal, and so including it in git as part of the CPython repo is preferred, but this increase the size of CPython\u0026rsquo;s git history.\nAdding it as a git submodule was brought up, but personally I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of git submodules, and others in the room also hesitated with it. Git submodule is unintuitive and not a good experience for the contributors, so it seemed like shipping it as part of CPython codebase would the path to go.\nBrandt said he will be opening a Discourse topic to further discuss it. He also shared his slides so you can check them out.\nHelPy (Helsinki Python Meetup) Python Quiz At Helsinki Python meetup, they quiz the attendees about Python, and winners get prize, like extra Python conference swag, or other knick-knacks. (I noticed the PyCon US 2024 coloring book there 😊)\nThe day before, they had quiz related to Python release cycles and Python features, so Hugo decided to quiz all the core devs too to see how well we really know Python.\nThat was fun and interesting! I liked this idea of quizzing people.

We learned that the campus was meant to be the new headquarters for REI (Recreational Equipment, Inc). However, REI never moved in so Meta bought the space.\nThe campus is beautiful, I noticed lots of elements of nature, outdoor spaces. There\u0026rsquo;s a really fancy kaleidoscope on the roof. There\u0026rsquo;s an ice cream cart in the afternoon, so we all get to have ice cream before returning to the sprint room.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Mariatta Wijaya (@mariatta81)\nPython conference t-shirts Python conference/Python-themed t-shirts worn by Python core devs today:\nPyCon US 2024 (Mariatta) Microsoft PyCon US 2016 swag (Thomas) PyCascades 2021 (Guido) EuroPython 2024 (Hugo) PyCon swag from Meta (Facebook like/thumbs up icon and the Python logo on the t-shirt) (Eric Snow) Dinner Meta arranged for a nice dinner for all of us at Anthony\u0026rsquo;s HomePort Kirkland.

The Developers in Residence are hired by The PSF to work full time to assist with core Python development. The roles are/have been funded by companies like Google, Meta, Bloomberg, etc (I lost track of which company is sponsoring this role nowadays, sorry)\nSome of the things discussed:\nWhat are their responsibilities and their focus area? How do they balance working for Python and being sponsored by external company. Petr said his work is unbiased/not influenced by the sponsor. (Personally, I think that such \u0026ldquo;bias\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;employer influence\u0026rdquo; already exists somewhat, but not with the DiRs. There are other core devs who are paid by their employers to work full time on CPython, so how is the DiR role any different? Anyway, that\u0026rsquo;s just my unimportant comment. This is my personal blog, so I can comment on anything) Russell mentioned that in DSF (Django Software Foundation)\u0026rsquo;s case, when they set up the Django Fellows role, the role has to be focused to administrative and community management, because as a 501 org, activties like \u0026ldquo;software development\u0026rdquo; is not considered \u0026ldquo;charitable\u0026rdquo; activity, so is there such constraints with the PSF\u0026rsquo;s Developer in Residence? Perhaps this is a question that should be answered by PSF instead of by the DiRs. Should more people get to vote in Python Steering Council Election? I\u0026rsquo;ve asked this question before, and today I asked if anyone at the sprint want to meet and chat about this.\nAs of today, 90 people in the world gets to vote in Python steering council election. Is this 90 people really the only group of people who should vote? It just felt too restrictive and limiting to me.\nSome of the arguments I\u0026rsquo;ve heard before were along the lines of \u0026ldquo;the core team members are the people who know best for Python\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;the people who know best about Python would already by core team members\u0026rdquo;.\nI actually think those two statements are False. I truly believe there are people outside of the current core team members who have the skills to make good languge decisions for Python. It is possible such people simply do not want to become a Python core team member (because it comes with a lot of responsibilities and commitment). Just because they are not a Python core team member, does not mean they are not suitable to decide for Python, and does not mean they should not be given voice.\nSo the question becomes, who else should we include in the election? And that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to find out.\nIn addition to all this, I\u0026rsquo;m also questioning: \u0026ldquo;are core team members really the right group of people to vote in Python Steering Council election?\u0026rdquo;. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I think (again, this is personal unpopular opinion): The current team is not actually very diverse. Not only that, there have been people who have voting privileges, and did not cast their vote. Though this is quite normal in elections. But on top of all this, I have heard one time, one of the voters said that they voted for everyone, which in my mind is actually the same as not voting at all. So if there are people within the core team who are not taking their responsibility seriously, then \u0026hellip; should they continue to have voting right?\nAgain, these are just my personal thoughts, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m in the minority among core team members for thinking like this.\nDuring our chat today, there are a few points being discussed:\nThe fact that there is no guarantee to Steering Council continuity, (and yet continuity is desired) it might caused people to vote more conservatively and preferring candidates who have served in SC before, instead of voting in riskier/newer SC candidates. This has actually been discussed before, so perhaps we need to keep discussing and come up with a path forward.\nDoes expanding the voter pool the right approach to solve our problem (if there is even a problem)\nDo other people really want to vote? Maybe the people who we think should be included as voters aren\u0026rsquo;t even interested in voting? I thought this was a great question and I wondered about this too. Prior to our meeting, I have posted a new Discourse thread asking exactly this. I really want to hear from various group of people about this topic. As mentioned, most core team members currently probably don\u0026rsquo;t really see the need to expand the voter pool, and therefore most of them will be unmotivated to keep this discussion going. But I care about this, so please give me this opportunity to give more Python community members to have more voice in the core Python development.\nPlease leave your feedback on my Discourse thread. Feel free to share this link with anyone who you think should know about it. Or let me know who else to reach out to.\nPyCon US Handover meeting Elaine (the next PyCon US Conference Chair) and I met (on video call) to chat about PyCon US Chair responsibilities. I spent time during the sprint to write up a documentation for her and for future conference chairs, share some advice, we also discussed of what could be improved/what should/could change, etc.\nElaine asked interesting questions which I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even thinking about before: How do I feel about the experience? What\u0026rsquo;s the takeaway from this experience? What are the things that I like/learned?\nTook me a few moment to think about this, but these are my thoughts about being a PyCon US conference chair:\nI realized that this position comes with power I get to use this power to make things happen There are things about PyCon US which I did not like, and things I think needed to change. Being able to actually make those changes, and make things work the way I want it to be, (instead of simply complaining to the void), is something I feel good about. I get to use this power to do more outreach, to advocate for, and to build my the communities I care a lot about, specifically the underrepresented and marginalized group members Python conference t-shirts Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I\u0026rsquo;m still paying attention to the Python Fashion 😎\nPython conference/Python-themed t-shirts worn by Python core devs today:\nPyCon US 2023 (Mariatta) PyLadies CZ (Petr) Black (Hugo and Jason) Python Pizza (Łukasz) PyCon US 2021 (Thomas) Dinner I ate dinner alone in my hotel room.

I felt like the example provided in the PEP doesn\u0026rsquo;t fully illustrate why a new syntax would be needed.

Each of us has our own little corner of focus area, an area they care a lot about.\nSo anyway, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important for eveyone to learn more about what they can do with f-strings in Python 3.12+ so shared my F-strings presentation slide on the Python Core Devs Discord channel. If you also want to learn more about what\u0026rsquo;s new with f-strings in Python 3.12, check my slides or wait for PyBay videos to come out.\nCoverity Scan I noticed that we have a page on the DevGuide about CPython Coverity Scan, but when I went to Coverity Scan website, it turns out that the project hasn\u0026rsquo;t been updated since 2020. The folks who are listed as contact person/admin/expert also haven\u0026rsquo;t looked into it for a long time. No-one seemed to remember how to even trigger a scan. So after some chats on Discord, we made a call to remove Coverity Scan from CPython repo and DevGuide.\nI opened a PR on the DevGuide repo to remove the coverity scan info, and I also opened a PR on CPython repo to remove the corresponding coverity model C file.\nYou know what I say: us programmers love writing code, but we love deleting code even more 😝\nI also tried to find out how to delete our CPython project from Coverity Scan. But Stack Overflow says it can\u0026rsquo;t be deleted 😥\nDevGuide I continued to read the CPython DevGuide source code (.rst files) thoroughly.\nI learned new .rst and Sphinx roles I never knew before, that are used on the DevGuide, like the :samp: and :guilabel: roles. These roles aren\u0026rsquo;t being used too extensively, there are 18 occurences of each of these roles in the devguide, so perhaps I just haven\u0026rsquo;t come across them before.\nGroup Photo We took a group photo together of all the sprint attendees, but the photo hasn\u0026rsquo;t been shared with us.\nQ\u0026amp;A with Python Steering Council During the Q\u0026amp;A session, core devs asked the SC about different topics:\nFreethreading\nThe acceptance of PEP 703 (Freethreading) was contractual and based on certain provisions. There was a question of, how is this going so far? There was a comment about, most people in the room are finding it doing quite well, but are we hearing from all parties? Are there people who don\u0026rsquo;t find it good, and how can we make sure they share this experience? There\u0026rsquo;s concern that the freethreading caused performance lag (about 30-40% slower), and questioning what can be done to speed it up? What can we do to help our users with freethreading? For the SC, making language decisions, they need to also think about the new features in the context of freethreading.\nPEP 734: Multiple Interpreters\nEric Snow wanted clarity of what needs to happen about this PEP. Emily mentioned the need to have changes like this to be available as a package first on PyPI, let the community try it first, before including in the standard library. She talked about this as a lightning talk at the Python Language Summit 2024.\nSC Office Hour\nThe SC encourages core devs to use their office hour more. The booking link is currently broken, but we can just write to the SC and they\u0026rsquo;ll work it out.\nSC workload\nThere\u0026rsquo;s way too many things to be done by the SC than they have the time to do. So what can be done, what can be delegated? There has been some improvements. Velda has been hired to help streamline the process about SC updates to the community. There has also been many different work groups (WG), charters, councils, board formed that takes ownership of certain focus area, and sounds like the SC would like to encourage more of that.\nRoundtable about CoC in the Core Python team CoC is a very heavy topic, and not everyone in the room wanted to participate, so we used a breakout room to discuss it.\nI joined the breakout room just to learn and listen to what others said. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really contributed anything to the discussion. Even as a listener, I still didn\u0026rsquo;t find it any easier being in that room. I could tell that, those who spoke during the breakout room, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t an easy thing to share their thoughts about this topic.\nSo I really appreciate that the group could have a chat about this topic in person in respectful manner.\nPython conference t-shirts The Python Fashion Watch continues!! 😎\nPython conference/Python-themed t-shirts worn by Python core devs today:\nPyCon Charlas 2024 (Thomas) PyCon US 2022 (?)

Thanks to the travel grant, my hotel stay is covered fully by The PSF.\nThank you to Meta and The PSF for hosting and sponsoring! The sprint is one of my favorite Python events of the year. At the sprint we all get to really focus and \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; on Python. It\u0026rsquo;s also nice being able to talk face-to-face IRL with other Python core team members. The sprint is only one of two events of the year in which there are so many Python core team members all in the same room. (The other event being the Python language summit at PyCon US.)\nDjangoCon US I actually have online DjangoCon US registration (thanks to my consulting client!). When I woke up, the conference just started, so I watched the morning keynote on my phone. The first keynote was by Sheena O\u0026rsquo;Connell, titled \u0026ldquo;Power to the People who Teach the People\u0026rdquo;. It was a great presentation, and I\u0026rsquo;d really recommend you to watch it, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re in a senior/lead dev role, or if you need to/want to mentor other devs.\nCheck out the slides here.\n(Got lost while) Getting to the venue We were informed that there will be limited monitors available, and it\u0026rsquo;s on a first-come-first-serve situation. The night before, a group of core devs said they would meet at the hotel lobby at 9:15 before heading out together. However, since I wanted to claim a monitor, I decided I\u0026rsquo;d go sooner than everybody else, at 8:30 AM. I asked if anyone else wanted to go together with me. Turned out, almost everyone wanted to come at the same time.\nOk, so,\u0026hellip; this large group of Python core devs went out together, we figured out the transit situation together, and \u0026hellip;. we all got lost together! 😂 When we arrived at the Meta building, we circled the entire block before we finally found the entrance to the building lobby. This is what happened when you try to figure something out before drinking your morning coffe 😓\nPyLadiesCon Program Committee The PyLadiesCon program committee had a meeting. We discussed keynote selection, panels, and the program schedule.\nPyPodcats Georgi reported that people weren\u0026rsquo;t able to \u0026ldquo;search\u0026rdquo; for our podcast series, PyPodcats, on Spotify. She said that people needed to type in the \u0026ldquo;PyPodcats\u0026rdquo; in that exact capitalization on Spotify to find the podcast. So I spent a bit of time investigating.\nI still don\u0026rsquo;t know how Spotify\u0026rsquo;s algorithm work, but while investigating, I found the Podcast Specification Doc from Spotify, which explains how the podcast RSS feed need to be structured and formatted for Spotify.\nWhile reading the doc, I noticed that we did not have the xmlns:spotify attribute yet on our XML schema. So I opened a PR to add this attribute to our RSS feed.\nSprint Kick-off At the kick-off, we went around the room and everyone introduced themselves, and stating what they\u0026rsquo;ll be working on during the sprint. Everyone has different things they wanted to work on: freethreading, asyncio, dataclass, tag/template strings (PEP 750), PEP process improvements, packaging (warehouse), etc.\nPython Contributing Guide Myself, I plan to focus on the work for Python Docs Editorial Board. One of the projects we\u0026rsquo;re undertaking is the re-working of the Python DevGuide into a \u0026ldquo;Contributing Guide\u0026rdquo;. Ned Batchelder has prepared an outline of what the new Contributing Guide could look like, and we\u0026rsquo;re currently looking for more feedback and eyes on it. If you have opinion about it, please check out the Discussion forum or and review the pull request.\nUnpopular Idea about Python Docs I have something in mind about the state of Python Docs, but it\u0026rsquo;s not gonna be popular among the Python core devs, so I won\u0026rsquo;t say out loud what it is yet 🤐 My idea is still just \u0026hellip; an idea. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know if my idea is even possible, so I still need to do some R\u0026amp;D on it.\nI mentioned it to a few people, and they gave me some pointers on how to approach it. (Though none of them was enthusiastic about it 😓)\nNot sure how far can I get with this idea, but I\u0026rsquo;d like to at least try or to be one step closer towards a solution. As part of this R\u0026amp;D effort, I\u0026rsquo;m currently reading the DevGuide from top to bottom, front and back.\nWhile I was reading the Devguide, I noticed hidden inside the devguide, are two \u0026ldquo;TODO\u0026rdquo; items that seemed to have been there for almost a year. So I opened some issues to hopefully address these TODOs. (Issue 1408 and Issue 1409)\nEditorial Board Meeting Minutes Since last month, the editorial-board has a landing page.\nI added a small new feature to it: now there is a new \u0026ldquo;Board Members\u0026rdquo; page, and each board member has their own landing page (and RSS Feed!) of the meetings in which they\u0026rsquo;re an attendee. (Here\u0026rsquo;s my page)\nI became interested to add this functionality after listening to Philip James\u0026rsquo; talk at PyBay about Automating Your City Data with Python. In his talk, he demonstrated how to lookup city council minutes, what topic was discussed during city council meetings, and which council members voted for which decisions.\nI implemented this using what\u0026rsquo;s called taxonomies in Hugo. PR with the change.\nI know this is an over-engineering of this simple meeting minutes, but I guess I just appreciate having more structured data.\nGidgethub There was a PR opened by Jacob Nesbitt on the Gidgethub repository, for adding an expiration parameter to gidgethub.apps.get_jwt(). This value is currently a hardcoded value of 10 minutes. The PR adds an optional parameter that allows users to set a custom value, and defaults to 10 minutes, making it backward-compatible. I thought it\u0026rsquo;s a great improvement. I reviewed the PR and tested it locally.\nPython conference t-shirts One weird thing you notice as a Python conference organizer, is which Python conference swag are being used by your Python friends 😅\nToday, I noticed a few people wearing different Python conference t-shirts, myself included, so it was fun to see 😁\nPython conference t-shirts worn by Python core devs today:\nPyCon Charlas 2024 (Guido) PyCon US 2024 (Lysandros) EuroPython 2023 (Hugo) PyCon US 2017 (Eric Snow) PyCon US 2016 (Thomas) PyCascades 2023 (Mariatta) Dinner I went for Ramen and ice cream for dinner.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Mariatta Wijaya (@mariatta81)\n","date":"September 23, 2024","hero":"/images/posts/pycoresprint2024selfie.jpg","permalink":"https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"python-core-sprint-2024-day-1\"\u003ePython Core Sprint 2024: Day 1\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week I\u0026rsquo;m in Bellevue for the annual Python core sprint.

Maybe you launched your public speaking or devrel career by meeting community members at meetups.\nIt is only fair that we say thanks to the Python people, who have helped us in our Python journey.\nThere are many ways to say thanks to our favorite Python community member.\nLevel 0: Actually say thanks to them Obviously, just say thanks.\nSay thanks to them when they released a new library version.\nSay thanks when they scheduled a meetup/conference.\nSay thanks when they posted a new blog post/tutorial/newsletter.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;re already doing this anyway, so please continue doing it.\nLevel 1: Say thanks in public Don\u0026rsquo;t keep things to yourself. Share the joy with your friends, colleagues, and your network.\nBy saying thanks in public, you\u0026rsquo;re giving visibility to their work, and the recognition they deserve. You\u0026rsquo;ll also be helping to further amplify the impact of their contributions, helping their content reach more audience, helping their tools and library be discovered and used by more people.\nFound a useful library that helped you at work? Tell others about it. Ok, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re already doing this by saying \u0026ldquo;thanks to library X, it makes my work easy.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t stop there! Be sure to mention their name: \u0026ldquo;Thanks to A who maintains library X, it makes my work easy.\u0026rdquo;\nI also want to challenge you to be even more specific, like, \u0026ldquo;Thanks to contributor B who made the PR for feature Y, it makes my work easy.\u0026rdquo;\nHow can you find out who the contributor or maintainer is? Thankfully, because you are using open source libraries, such info is also available out in the open. The challenge is we don\u0026rsquo;t always know where to look for such info, or worse, we take things for granted, and didn\u0026rsquo;t bother finding out.\nSo here are some ways to find out who the maintainers/contributors are:\nFind the project\u0026rsquo;s GitHub repository, look at the list of contributors and pull requests. Find the project\u0026rsquo;s changelog/release notes (You\u0026rsquo;re probably already reading this anyway!) Go to the project\u0026rsquo;s PyPI page, the maintainers are usually listed there Do this for community contributions too! Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;That Python conference was great, you should go next time!\u0026rdquo;, say \u0026ldquo;Thanks to the program chair X who selected great talks for the conference.\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Thanks to speaker Y who gave this talk about Z\u0026rdquo;.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t take a lot of time to write up a such messages on your social media posts. Plus, you\u0026rsquo;ll look cool and well-traveled by showing off that you just went to a conference, or that you just use some cool new library. Win-win.\nLevel 2: Show your support Show that you\u0026rsquo;re interested in their work, that you want them to continue maintaining the library, you want them to give more talks, or you want them to put the next year\u0026rsquo;s conference. Don\u0026rsquo;t wait until they finished doing all that before you say thanks!\nYou can show that you support them by subscribing to their newsletter/blog/YouTube channel, or by following them on social media.\nLevel 3: Contribute to their project/ Volunteer at the community Don\u0026rsquo;t just use their library. Contribute back. Find their GitHub repo, check the contributing guide, learn their workflow, and start contributing.\nSome projects can be picky about their contributing workflow, for example some projects absolutely want you to first create a ticket. Therefore, do spend time reading their contributing guide, maybe lurk in their discussion forum, and learn how other existing contributors do it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t just attend conferences/meetup. Offer to help and volunteer.\nBut offering to help can be tricky. There are so many things that event organizers do behind the scene. Each role has specific requirements in terms of the level of commitment needed.\nWhen offering to help with the community events, like meetup/conferences, don\u0026rsquo;t just say \u0026ldquo;I want to help, tell me how\u0026rdquo;. Offering to help is appreciated, but at the same time, it gives them work because now they have to figure out what roles to give to you.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the trick to make it easier for them to accept your help!\nInstead of saying \u0026ldquo;Tell me how to help\u0026rdquo;, I recommend you be super specific about the kind of help you want/can do, and additionally be honest about your availability. So you can say things like, \u0026ldquo;I want to help with program review, because I have experience giving talks and writing good proposals. I can be available during month X.\u0026rdquo;.\nGiving them these details and showing that you can commit to the volunteer role, will make it easier for them to decide whether to onboard you into their volunteer team or not.\nIn order for you to successfully offer your help, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to invest a bit more time in understanding how their community work.\nJust like code contribution, where you need to spend time learning their contributor\u0026rsquo;s workflow before actually contributing, you would need to spend time learning more about the community, before you can start volunteering to the community.\nLevel 4: Contribute money Don\u0026rsquo;t have time to actually contribute/volunteer? You can give money instead!\nSponsor your favorite open source maintainer on GitHub, OpenCollective, become a Patron on their Patreon, buy them coffee, send them PayPal, etc. If you couldn\u0026rsquo;t find such info, then ask them. Even if they end up saying, that no they can\u0026rsquo;t accept monetary payment from you, at least you\u0026rsquo;ll make them feel valued.\nIf you have a favorite Python conference, be sure to check their sponsorship prospectus, and tell your employer to sponsor the event.\nLevel 5: Nominate them for Awards There are many awards in the Python and open source community. I would especially recommend that you recognize those outside of North America, those underrepresented in tech industry, those from marginalized community. For them, receiving awards from well-established organizations could really improve their career.\nSo not only you\u0026rsquo;ll be showing your gratitude and admiration to your favorite Python person, you could directly make an impact in their life. When they don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about their career, they\u0026rsquo;ll have more time to continue maintaining the library you depend on, or continue running the events you enjoyed so much.\nAfter all they\u0026rsquo;ve done for the community, I\u0026rsquo;m sure you agree that they deserve to be recognized.\nMaybe you\u0026rsquo;re thinking, this person is so admirable, surely someone else had nominated them for the award, surely they have received the award already. Well don\u0026rsquo;t just guess or assume. Verify that by actually checking the list of past award recipient to see if they\u0026rsquo;re there.

Now go think of at least one Python people in your life, (like, a blogger, open source maintainer, speaker, local meetup organizer, conference organizer, podcaster, etc), and thank them by doing one or more of the above!\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t think of anyone, perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s because you haven\u0026rsquo;t joined the community. So go attend your local Python meetups or look for upcoming Python conferences.

The Python community members contribute in many ways and in many forms.\nThe obvious ones are code contributions, by maintaining or contributing to the open\nsource library that you depend on. Other forms of contributions are in the form of documentation, tutorials, educational\ncontent, bloggers, and public speakers. Other kind of contributions that are often unseen and not obvious are\ncommunity leaders who run your local Python meetups, and regional conferences.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["Python","Community","PyLadies"],"title":"How to Say Thanks to Python People"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Django Oauth Toolkit The Django Oauth Toolkit is a powerful library for adding OAuth2 functionalities out of the box for your Django app. The library comes with pre-defined models, views, urls, and templates for managing OAuth2 authorization and flow.\nThe Application Model Django OAuth Toolkit provides a basic model for the OAuth2 Application, this is a model that represents a Client on the Authorization server. It has fields like client_id, user, redirect_uris, client_secret, etc.\nExtending the Application Model Perhaps you may need to extend the Application model with your own\u0026rsquo;s custom fields. For example, as described in the Django OAuth Toolkit documentation, you might want to add a logo to your Application, or adding a flag to agreeing to the terms of use, etc.\nIt can be done by extending the oauth2_provider.models.AbstractApplication.\nThe key thing though, you must do this at the very beginning of your project, before you ran the initial oauth2_provider migration step.\nThe documentation explains how to do this.\nCreate a new Custom Application:\nfrom django.db import models from oauth2_provider.models import AbstractApplication class MyApplication(AbstractApplication): logo = models.ImageField() agree = models.BooleanField() Update the Django settings, add the OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL variable, pointing to the new custom app:\nOAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL = \u0026#34;your_app_name.MyApplication\u0026#34; Creating new model means that you need to create the migration for it, by running:\npython manage.py makemigrations your_app_name Force the migration of your new model, ensuring it to be run before the oauth2_provider migrations. Add to your app\u0026rsquo;s migration file:\nrun_before = [ (\u0026#34;oauth2_provider\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0001_initial\u0026#34;), ] Run the django migration.\npython manage.py migrate Extending the Application Model mid-project As mentioned above, the documented way to use a custom Application model is by creating it at the beginning of the project.\nBut, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re using this library for the first time. You didn\u0026rsquo;t know you\u0026rsquo;d need a custom model. You ended up just using the built-in model, deployed to production. Maybe much later in the development cycle, you then realized that you need to extend it.\nWhat if you need to create the new custom application model after the initial migration oauth2_provider has been run?\nThis is what happened in my client\u0026rsquo;s project. We had a project going that\u0026rsquo;s been using the built-in Application model, however now the project requirement changed, and we needed to extend it.\nWhen I tried swapping the Application model with a custom one, I got some errors when running the migration, or when using the token.\nHere are some example error messages that we\u0026rsquo;ve seen:\nMigration oauth2_provider.0001_initial is applied before its dependency your_app_name.0001_initial on database \u0026#39;default\u0026#39;. insert or update on table \u0026#34;oauth2_provider_accesstoken\u0026#34; violates foreign key constraint \u0026#34;oauth2_provider_acce_application_id_b22886e1_fk_oauth2_pr\u0026#34; DETAIL: Key (application_id)=(3) is not present in table \u0026#34;oauth2_provider_application\u0026#34;. What to do about it When I first saw the message about a migration being applied before the dependency app, I thought, perhaps I could just reset the migration, like:\npython manage.py migrate oauth2_provider zero However, it didn\u0026rsquo;t work, because the migration is not reversible.\nAfter some trial and error, I found some workaround.\nBefore you go ahead and copy-paste the snippets below, please read the aftermath first to understand the risks. Here\u0026rsquo;s what happened in the end.\nDowntime. Deployment stopped. Co-workers complained about broken local environment. Tables got dropped. Existing OAuth apps got deleted. Existing users needed to re-create their OAuth Applications. (And update their client id/secret, etc.) Not good. In my client\u0026rsquo;s case, the users of the OAuth Applications are quite small, and rather internal, so the downtime was something we could bear. This might not work for you, and perhaps, I mean, surely there\u0026rsquo;s a better way to do it?\nAnyway, here are the things I did, just in case you have the same problem we faced, and you want to proceed anyway.\nMake the code changes as mentioned above, ie. create the custom Application model, update the settings file, set the OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL setting, create the migration file, and add the run_before step to it. But, do not run the migration file. (Well you can run it, but you\u0026rsquo;ll get an error, so it just won\u0026rsquo;t work).\nGo back to the model\u0026rsquo;s migration file, and comment the code where it says run_before.\n# run_before = [ # (\u0026#34;oauth2_provider\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0001_initial\u0026#34;), # ] Go back to the settings, and comment out the line for OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL.\n# OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL = \u0026#34;your_app_name.MyApplication\u0026#34; Revert the oauth2_provider migration using --fake:\npython manage.py migrate --fake oauth2_provider zero Restore the changes from step 2. and 3. above. Eg uncomment the run_before, and the OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL lines.\nEg. make sure the code looks like this again:\nOAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL = \u0026#34;your_app_name.MyApplication\u0026#34; and\nrun_before = [ (\u0026#34;oauth2_provider\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0001_initial\u0026#34;), ] On the terminal, open Django dbshell.\npython manage.py dbshell Inside the dbshell, drop the oauth2_provider tables.\nDROP TABLE oauth2_provider_accesstoken CASCADE; DROP TABLE oauth2_provider_grant CASCADE; DROP TABLE oauth2_provider_idtoken CASCADE; DROP TABLE oauth2_provider_refreshtoken CASCADE; Exit dbshell.\n\\q Now the Django migration can run without errors.\npython manage.py migrate I did all the steps from 1 to 9 above, it worked for me locally. But now the trouble is, how to deploy such a change?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what we end up doing. (which caused the deployment to stop, and co-workers \u0026ldquo;complained\u0026rdquo;).\nI committed the code changes mentioned on step 1 (and then pushed, and merged the PR). This way my co-workers (and the staging environment) received the code containing the new model and migration files.\nThen I told them that they need to do steps 2-9 on their own. eg. ask them to comment a few lines of code, drop their tables, and uncomment the codes again, and re-run their migration. I\u0026rsquo;ve included the documentation and step-by-step instructions just like the one I wrote above, and additionally offered to pair program and help them resolve it.\nWe did this change on the staging environment too. After making sure that the process worked like this on staging, (and after confirming that co-workers\u0026rsquo; issues are resolved) that\u0026rsquo;s when we deployed to production and break the production for a few minutes.\nIs there a better way to do this? I\u0026rsquo;m sure the way I did it is not the right way to fix it. Not everyone can afford such downtime.\nIf you know of a better way, please let me know, or update the issue.\nI\u0026rsquo;m wondering, perhaps the useful thing to do is to just always begin with a custom Application model from the get go. Right now, the topic about extending the Application model is not mentioned in the \u0026ldquo;Get Started\u0026rdquo; documentation, but appears much later under \u0026ldquo;Advanced topics.\u0026rdquo;\nPerhaps the docs should recommend user to always create the custom Application, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t need additional fields.\nPerhaps it should be written in bold somewhere that \u0026ldquo;using the built-in Application model means you can\u0026rsquo;t change it down the road\u0026rdquo;.\nAnyway, thanks for reading, and I hope you find it useful.\nAbout Django OAuth Toolkit GitHub Repo: https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit Documentation: https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ On PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/django-oauth-toolkit/ License: BSD License ","date":"August 30, 2024","hero":"/images/posts/sep2020.jpg","permalink":"https://mariatta.ca/posts/extending-dj-oauth-toolkit-model/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"django-oauth-toolkit\"\u003eDjango Oauth Toolkit\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eDjango Oauth Toolkit\u003c/a\u003e is a powerful library for\nadding OAuth2 functionalities out of the box for your Django app.\nThe library comes with pre-defined models, views, urls, and templates for managing OAuth2 authorization and flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-application-model\"\u003eThe Application Model\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango OAuth Toolkit provides a basic model for the OAuth2 Application, this is a model that represents a Client on\nthe Authorization server.

PEPs are more than just a style guide. A PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It\u0026rsquo;s a proposal documentation for when you want to change the Python programming language in a big way, for example when you want to change the syntax of Python. Think of the addition of f-strings, the walrus operator, or the ExceptionGroup, those changes all started with a PEP.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a PEP talk, where you can learn about the PEP process, what needs a PEP and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and how you as community members can take part.\nContact me (links below) if you\u0026rsquo;d like to hear this talk at your event.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Mariatta Wijaya (@mariatta81)\nPresented At North Bay Python 2023 PyGotham 2023 Videos North Bay Python 2023 Slide Deck Intended Audience This is aimed for newcomers and beginners of Python, who may have only heard of PEP 8 and not so much of other PEPs. I will cover what PEPs really are, the purpose, examples of PEPs, and how community member can participate if they want to.\nTalk Outline What\u0026rsquo;s a PEP (\u0026lt; 5 minutes)\nYou know of PEP 8 But there are other PEPs A PEP is a proposal: it\u0026rsquo;s a documentation for changes to Python What kind of Changes Need a PEP? (5 minutes)\nIf you want to add new syntax Example: f-strings, ExceptionGroup, the \u0026ldquo;walrus\u0026rdquo; operator Other things that have a PEP (5 minutes)\nRelease schedule Governance Informational (Style Guide) PEP lifecycle (10 minutes)\nHow it works: start with discussing it in a public forum (like Discourse or the Python Language Summit) If there is consensus and agreement of the idea, then a PEP will need to be written Steering Council review and approve (or reject) the PEP Once approved, the feature can go to the next Python release After the feature has been done: PEP becomes final. But PEP is not a documentation: you should read the Python docs after PEP has become final All of these can take months, even years Your role (5 minutes)\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t agree with a proposal (if it cause you hardship in the way you use Python), the best way to voice your concern is during PEP discussion period, before the SC approval, and before the release of Python. Sometimes new feature cause breakage, do test your codebase against the Python main branch, or alpha versions.
