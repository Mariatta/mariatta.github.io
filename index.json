[{"categories":null,"contents":"The Python Community Python is not just code, but a community. The Python community members contribute in many ways and in many forms. The obvious ones are code contributions, by maintaining or contributing to the open source library that you depend on. Other forms of contributions are in the form of documentation, tutorials, educational content, bloggers, and public speakers. Other kind of contributions that are often unseen and not obvious are community leaders who run your local Python meetups, and regional conferences.\nAs users of Python, we benefited from these contributions one way or the other. Other than you\u0026rsquo;ve already been using Python for free to get paid and improve your life and career, I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;ve also gained experience by watching conference talks, listening to Python podcasts, reading blog posts and newsletters.\nMaybe you got a new job through connections you\u0026rsquo;ve made at a Python conference. Maybe you launched your public speaking or devrel career by meeting community members at meetups.\nIt is only fair that we say thanks to the Python people, who have helped us in our Python journey.\nThere are many ways to say thanks to our favorite Python community member.\nLevel 0: Actually say thanks to them Obviously, just say thanks.\nSay thanks to them when they released a new library version.\nSay thanks when they scheduled a meetup/conference.\nSay thanks when they posted a new blog post/tutorial/newsletter.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;re already doing this anyway, so please continue doing it.\nLevel 1: Say thanks in public Don\u0026rsquo;t keep things to yourself. Share the joy with your friends, colleagues, and your network.\nBy saying thanks in public, you\u0026rsquo;re giving visibility to their work, and the recognition they deserve. You\u0026rsquo;ll also be helping to further amplify the impact of their contributions, helping their content reach more audience, helping their tools and library be discovered and used by more people.\nFound a useful library that helped you at work? Tell others about it. Ok, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re already doing this by saying \u0026ldquo;thanks to library X, it makes my work easy.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t stop there! Be sure to mention their name: \u0026ldquo;Thanks to A who maintains library X, it makes my work easy.\u0026rdquo;\nI also want to challenge you to be even more specific, like, \u0026ldquo;Thanks to contributor B who made the PR for feature Y, it makes my work easy.\u0026rdquo;\nHow can you find out who the contributor or maintainer is? Thankfully, because you are using open source libraries, such info is also available out in the open. The challenge is we don\u0026rsquo;t always know where to look for such info, or worse, we take things for granted, and didn\u0026rsquo;t bother finding out.\nSo here are some ways to find out who the maintainers/contributors are:\nFind the project\u0026rsquo;s GitHub repository, look at the list of contributors and pull requests. Find the project\u0026rsquo;s changelog/release notes (You\u0026rsquo;re probably already reading this anyway!) Go to the project\u0026rsquo;s PyPI page, the maintainers are usually listed there Do this for community contributions too! Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;That Python conference was great, you should go next time!\u0026rdquo;, say \u0026ldquo;Thanks to the program chair X who selected great talks for the conference.\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Thanks to speaker Y who gave this talk about Z\u0026rdquo;.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t take a lot of time to write up a such messages on your social media posts. Plus, you\u0026rsquo;ll look cool and well-traveled by showing off that you just went to a conference, or that you just use some cool new library. Win-win.\nLevel 2: Show your support Show that you\u0026rsquo;re interested in their work, that you want them to continue maintaining the library, you want them to give more talks, or you want them to put the next year\u0026rsquo;s conference. Don\u0026rsquo;t wait until they finished doing all that before you say thanks!\nYou can show that you support them by subscribing to their newsletter/blog/YouTube channel, or by following them on social media.\nLevel 3: Contribute to their project/ Volunteer at the community Don\u0026rsquo;t just use their library. Contribute back. Find their GitHub repo, check the contributing guide, learn their workflow, and start contributing.\nSome projects can be picky about their contributing workflow, for example some projects absolutely want you to first create a ticket. Therefore, do spend time reading their contributing guide, maybe lurk in their discussion forum, and learn how other existing contributors do it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t just attend conferences/meetup. Offer to help and volunteer.\nBut offering to help can be tricky. There are so many things that event organizers do behind the scene. Each role has specific requirements in terms of the level of commitment needed.\nWhen offering to help with the community events, like meetup/conferences, don\u0026rsquo;t just say \u0026ldquo;I want to help, tell me how\u0026rdquo;. Offering to help is appreciated, but at the same time, it gives them work because now they have to figure out what roles to give to you.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the trick to make it easier for them to accept your help!\nInstead of saying \u0026ldquo;Tell me how to help\u0026rdquo;, I recommend you be super specific about the kind of help you want/can do, and additionally be honest about your availability. So you can say things like, \u0026ldquo;I want to help with program review, because I have experience giving talks and writing good proposals. I can be available during month X.\u0026rdquo;.\nGiving them these details and showing that you can commit to the volunteer role, will make it easier for them to decide whether to onboard you into their volunteer team or not.\nIn order for you to successfully offer your help, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to invest a bit more time in understanding how their community work.\nJust like code contribution, where you need to spend time learning their contributor\u0026rsquo;s workflow before actually contributing, you would need to spend time learning more about the community, before you can start volunteering to the community.\nLevel 4: Contribute money Don\u0026rsquo;t have time to actually contribute/volunteer? You can give money instead!\nSponsor your favorite open source maintainer on GitHub, OpenCollective, become a Patron on their Patreon, buy them coffee, send them PayPal, etc. If you couldn\u0026rsquo;t find such info, then ask them. Even if they end up saying, that no they can\u0026rsquo;t accept monetary payment from you, at least you\u0026rsquo;ll make them feel valued.\nIf you have a favorite Python conference, be sure to check their sponsorship prospectus, and tell your employer to sponsor the event.\nLevel 5: Nominate them for Awards There are many awards in the Python and open source community. I would especially recommend that you recognize those outside of North America, those underrepresented in tech industry, those from marginalized community. For them, receiving awards from well-established organizations could really improve their career.\nSo not only you\u0026rsquo;ll be showing your gratitude and admiration to your favorite Python person, you could directly make an impact in their life. When they don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about their career, they\u0026rsquo;ll have more time to continue maintaining the library you depend on, or continue running the events you enjoyed so much.\nAfter all they\u0026rsquo;ve done for the community, I\u0026rsquo;m sure you agree that they deserve to be recognized.\nMaybe you\u0026rsquo;re thinking, this person is so admirable, surely someone else had nominated them for the award, surely they have received the award already. Well don\u0026rsquo;t just guess or assume. Verify that by actually checking the list of past award recipient to see if they\u0026rsquo;re there. If not, go nominate them now.\nPython Community Service Award from Python Software Foundation Given to members of the community who significantly improve the Foundation\u0026rsquo;s fulfillment of its mission.\nThe reward: $599 USD, and free registration at all future PyCon US event.

It has fields like client_id, user, redirect_uris, client_secret, etc.\nExtending the Application Model Perhaps you may need to extend the Application model with your own\u0026rsquo;s custom fields. For example, as described in the Django OAuth Toolkit documentation, you might want to add a logo to your Application, or adding a flag to agreeing to the terms of use, etc.\nIt can be done by extending the oauth2_provider.models.AbstractApplication.\nThe key thing though, you must do this at the very beginning of your project, before you ran the initial oauth2_provider migration step.\nThe documentation explains how to do this.\nCreate a new Custom Application:\nfrom django.db import models from oauth2_provider.models import AbstractApplication class MyApplication(AbstractApplication): logo = models.ImageField() agree = models.BooleanField() Update the Django settings, add the OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL variable, pointing to the new custom app:\nOAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL = \u0026#34;your_app_name.MyApplication\u0026#34; Creating new model means that you need to create the migration for it, by running:\npython manage.py makemigrations your_app_name Force the migration of your new model, ensuring it to be run before the oauth2_provider migrations. Add to your app\u0026rsquo;s migration file:\nrun_before = [ (\u0026#34;oauth2_provider\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0001_initial\u0026#34;), ] Run the django migration.\npython manage.py migrate Extending the Application Model mid-project As mentioned above, the documented way to use a custom Application model is by creating it at the beginning of the project.\nBut, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re using this library for the first time. You didn\u0026rsquo;t know you\u0026rsquo;d need a custom model. You ended up just using the built-in model, deployed to production. Maybe much later in the development cycle, you then realized that you need to extend it.\nWhat if you need to create the new custom application model after the initial migration oauth2_provider has been run?\nThis is what happened in my client\u0026rsquo;s project. We had a project going that\u0026rsquo;s been using the built-in Application model, however now the project requirement changed, and we needed to extend it.\nWhen I tried swapping the Application model with a custom one, I got some errors when running the migration, or when using the token.\nHere are some example error messages that we\u0026rsquo;ve seen:\nMigration oauth2_provider.0001_initial is applied before its dependency your_app_name.0001_initial on database \u0026#39;default\u0026#39;. insert or update on table \u0026#34;oauth2_provider_accesstoken\u0026#34; violates foreign key constraint \u0026#34;oauth2_provider_acce_application_id_b22886e1_fk_oauth2_pr\u0026#34; DETAIL: Key (application_id)=(3) is not present in table \u0026#34;oauth2_provider_application\u0026#34;. What to do about it When I first saw the message about a migration being applied before the dependency app, I thought, perhaps I could just reset the migration, like:\npython manage.py migrate oauth2_provider zero However, it didn\u0026rsquo;t work, because the migration is not reversible.\nAfter some trial and error, I found some workaround.\nBefore you go ahead and copy-paste the snippets below, please read the aftermath first to understand the risks. Here\u0026rsquo;s what happened in the end.\nDowntime. Deployment stopped. Co-workers complained about broken local environment. Tables got dropped. Existing OAuth apps got deleted. Existing users needed to re-create their OAuth Applications. (And update their client id/secret, etc.) Not good. In my client\u0026rsquo;s case, the users of the OAuth Applications are quite small, and rather internal, so the downtime was something we could bear. This might not work for you, and perhaps, I mean, surely there\u0026rsquo;s a better way to do it?\nAnyway, here are the things I did, just in case you have the same problem we faced, and you want to proceed anyway.\nMake the code changes as mentioned above, ie. create the custom Application model, update the settings file, set the OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL setting, create the migration file, and add the run_before step to it. But, do not run the migration file. (Well you can run it, but you\u0026rsquo;ll get an error, so it just won\u0026rsquo;t work).\nGo back to the model\u0026rsquo;s migration file, and comment the code where it says run_before.\n# run_before = [ # (\u0026#34;oauth2_provider\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0001_initial\u0026#34;), # ] Go back to the settings, and comment out the line for OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL.\n# OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL = \u0026#34;your_app_name.MyApplication\u0026#34; Revert the oauth2_provider migration using --fake:\npython manage.py migrate --fake oauth2_provider zero Restore the changes from step 2. and 3. above. Eg uncomment the run_before, and the OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL lines.\nEg. make sure the code looks like this again:\nOAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL = \u0026#34;your_app_name.MyApplication\u0026#34; and\nrun_before = [ (\u0026#34;oauth2_provider\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0001_initial\u0026#34;), ] On the terminal, open Django dbshell.\npython manage.py dbshell Inside the dbshell, drop the oauth2_provider tables.\nDROP TABLE oauth2_provider_accesstoken CASCADE; DROP TABLE oauth2_provider_grant CASCADE; DROP TABLE oauth2_provider_idtoken CASCADE; DROP TABLE oauth2_provider_refreshtoken CASCADE; Exit dbshell.\n\\q Now the Django migration can run without errors.\npython manage.py migrate I did all the steps from 1 to 9 above, it worked for me locally. But now the trouble is, how to deploy such a change?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what we end up doing. (which caused the deployment to stop, and co-workers \u0026ldquo;complained\u0026rdquo;).\nI committed the code changes mentioned on step 1 (and then pushed, and merged the PR). This way my co-workers (and the staging environment) received the code containing the new model and migration files.\nThen I told them that they need to do steps 2-9 on their own. eg. ask them to comment a few lines of code, drop their tables, and uncomment the codes again, and re-run their migration. I\u0026rsquo;ve included the documentation and step-by-step instructions just like the one I wrote above, and additionally offered to pair program and help them resolve it.\nWe did this change on the staging environment too. After making sure that the process worked like this on staging, (and after confirming that co-workers\u0026rsquo; issues are resolved) that\u0026rsquo;s when we deployed to production and break the production for a few minutes.\nIs there a better way to do this? I\u0026rsquo;m sure the way I did it is not the right way to fix it. Not everyone can afford such downtime.\nIf you know of a better way, please let me know, or update the issue.\nI\u0026rsquo;m wondering, perhaps the useful thing to do is to just always begin with a custom Application model from the get go. Right now, the topic about extending the Application model is not mentioned in the \u0026ldquo;Get Started\u0026rdquo; documentation, but appears much later under \u0026ldquo;Advanced topics.\u0026rdquo;\nPerhaps the docs should recommend user to always create the custom Application, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t need additional fields.\nPerhaps it should be written in bold somewhere that \u0026ldquo;using the built-in Application model means you can\u0026rsquo;t change it down the road\u0026rdquo;.\nAnyway, thanks for reading, and I hope you find it useful.\nAbout Django OAuth Toolkit GitHub Repo: https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit Documentation: https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ On PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/django-oauth-toolkit/ License: BSD License ","date":"August 30, 2024","hero":"/images/posts/sep2020.jpg","permalink":"https://mariatta.ca/posts/extending-dj-oauth-toolkit-model/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"django-oauth-toolkit\"\u003eDjango Oauth Toolkit\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eDjango Oauth Toolkit\u003c/a\u003e is a powerful library for\nadding OAuth2 functionalities out of the box for your Django app.\nThe library comes with pre-defined models, views, urls, and templates for managing OAuth2 authorization and flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-application-model\"\u003eThe Application Model\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango OAuth Toolkit provides a basic model for the OAuth2 Application, this is a model that represents a Client on\nthe Authorization server.

But PEP is not a documentation: you should read the Python docs after PEP has become final All of these can take months, even years Your role (5 minutes)\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t agree with a proposal (if it cause you hardship in the way you use Python), the best way to voice your concern is during PEP discussion period, before the SC approval, and before the release of Python. Sometimes new feature cause breakage, do test your codebase against the Python main branch, or alpha versions.
