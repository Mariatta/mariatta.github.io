  paper:
    summary: "If you use Python, chances are you've heard of PEP 8, the Python style guide. But do you know what PEPs really are? PEPs are more than just a style guide. A PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It's a proposal documentation for when you want to change the Python programming language in a big way, for example when you want to change the syntax of Python. Think of the addition of f-strings, the walrus operator, or the ExceptionGroup, those changes all started with a PEP. Let's have a PEP talk, where you can learn about the PEP process, what needs a PEP and what doesn't, and how you as community members can take part."
