# Oops! I Became an Open Source Maintainer

## Talk Abstract

I consider myself relatively new to the open source world; my first open source contribution was in summer of 2016. Pretty soon I found myself being given commit rights to other people‚Äôs open source projects. Being a new open source maintainer brings a set of unique challenges that I was not fully prepared for. In this talk, I will share my journey and the things I‚Äôve learned along the way, and some advice for other aspiring open source maintainers and contributors.
