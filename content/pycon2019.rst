I arrived in Cleveland last night for PyCon 2019! It'll be quite busy and jam-packed
event for me!! Looking forward to meet old friends and make new ones!

The following are my pre-planned PyCon activities. But I'm sure in actuality
I'll be even more busier for the unplanned ones! üòÖ

- **Wednesday**: `Python Language Summit <https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/>`_,
  co-chairing with ≈Åukasz. I'm also going to present the topic about `PEP 581
  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/>`_ / `PEP 588
  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0588/>`_. Followed by PyCon staff dinner. üòã

- **Thursday**: Andrew Svetlov and I will be giving our tutorial together: `Hands-on
  Intro to aiohttp <https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/68/>`_. I'll
  also be checking the expo hall for the opening reception.

- **Friday**: I plan to attend the keynote, and then my own talk: `Don't Be a
  Robot; Build the Bot <https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/218/>`_
  (Friday 10:50 a.m.‚Äì11:20 a.m. in Grand Ballroom B). I'll also be at Zapier's
  booth (#713) from 3:45 - 4:30 PM. Come find me!

- **Saturday**: Attend the morning keynotes, and again at Zapier's booth (#713)
  from 10:10 ‚Äì 10:50 AM. PSF Member's lunch, and then the `Mentored Sprint for
  Diverse Beginners <https://mentored-sprint-for-diverse-beginners.readthedocs.io/>`_,
  co-organized with Tania, Nina, and Nikoleta.

- **Sunday**: Attend all the keynotes. Sviatoslav Sydorenko and I plan to do
  an open space at 11 AM, with topic: **GitHub Bots are one honking great idea --
  let's do more of those! Let's talk about building GitHub Apps as a community**.
  PyLadies lunch. Receive my `PSF Community Service
  <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-north-star-of-pycascades-core.html>`_
  award. Dinner with my brother. This might be the last time in many years
  before I'll get to see him again.

- **Monday**: Sprint! Probably try to catch up with all the things I've been missing
  out since I went OOOS.

- **Tuesday**: Go home!

Ice Cream Selfie
----------------

So unlike me, I have not decided where to go for `Ice Cream Selfie <../ics-pyconus-2018.html>`_!!
üò± Last year I went to `Mitchell's Homemade Ice Cream <../>`_.
