Been a while since my last `weekly update <../weekly-update-april-30-2019.html>`_ üòÖ
I spent a week in Cleveland for PyCon US, and I've
`written a post just for that <../mariatta-pycon-2019-recap>`_.

This weekly update covers the week after I returned from PyCon and this
week's activities.

Work
----

- Last week I was playing catch up after missing work for a whole week. I also
  started re-working a PR I made. I was working on creating a ``v3`` API endpoint,
  but we needed it as ``v4``.

- This week we had our first "remote" engineering retreat. Historically our
  engineering retreats have been happening as in person retreat, e.g. last
  year the engineering group met up in Phoenix, AZ. This year we're experimenting
  with a "remote" retreat. We still receive the goodness of a retreat such as
  food budget and significant other's gift.


Python and the community
------------------------

- Trying to wrap up the mentored sprint for diverse beginners. I'm supposed to
  send out thank you emails and feedback forms. I've started email draft,
  and my teammates have started reviewing, but I haven't had time to address
  them yet. I will try finish this up this weekend!

- Trying to wrap up Python Language Summit with ≈Åukasz. We sent out thank you
  emails along with link to the feedback form. Some feedback started coming in.
  Lots of great ideas and definitely lots of room for improvement for both of us.

- Started chatting with Nathaniel about bots and automation for Trio project. He
  has lots of interesting ideas! I'm excited to help him build the bots! I plan
  to allocate some of my free time next month (June) to work on this.

- I was alerted about `miss-islington being broken
  <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2019-May/006728.html>`_. üòü
  I think this is a problem with ``Redis`` and ``celery``, but I haven't fully figure out
  how to fix this yet. So the error is still occurring sporadically.

- Started chatting with Andrew about aiohttp-bot. I'm now a member of `aio-libs
  <https://github.com/aio-libs>`_ team! üòÑ

- Started chatting with Elaine on how to best manage, triage, and handle
  info @ pyladies dot com email address. We've set up GMail filters. We're splitting
  work, taking turns tending the mailbox every 2 weeks.  I've set up some
  Slack bots and automation.

- `PEP 581 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/>`_ has been accepted by
  steering council! It means we **are** going to move to GitHub issues.
  Now we need to work on `PEP 588 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0588/>`_
  to outline the technical details of the migration.

- Interview with a journalist about Python.

- Started chatting with Paul Everitt about doing a webinar for PyCharm.
  Stay tuned!

- Talked to different people about CoC issues happening in the different
  communities I'm in.

- Started chatting with Eric about PyCascades. We met with Sage Sharp to get
  professional advice about CoC handling in our community.

- Lots of chores at home! üòõ We still have lots of unpacking to do. Most of our
  belongings are still distributed among many boxes.

- Made lots of return trip to our old home. We had different contractors coming
  in to do repairs. Hoping to get it all done end of the month, so we can put
  it up for sale.

- Went on a hike around `Buntzen Lake <http://www.buntzenlake.ca/>`_ with my family. üèû

- Doing last minute planning and preparation for my travel next week üòµ

- I watched Street Food on Netflix, the Yogyakarta episode. This episode brought
  tears to my eyes. I choked up each time I heard (and see) the old lady, Mbah
  Satinem, speaking and telling her life story. I didn't quite understand
  why initially, but I think I do now. For the first time in a long time, I was
  able to feel immediate connection with someone on TV. The way she speaks,
  it was just so familiar, like someone I've known forever. It was real
  Indonesian spirit, not an act, no drama. I think I finally understand
  what it means to feel "represented". I know that all of this sounds weird to
  most people.... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
