Exhaustion! üòµ

Work
----

- Started working with a new manager.

- Learned that one team member will be moving over to another team.

- A pairing session.

- Completed a sprint.

- Got my annual raise.

- Support shift.

Python and the community
------------------------

- Answered various emails regarding `Python Language Summit <https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/>`_
  and the `mentored sprint <https://us.pycon.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/>`_.

- Set up a (Zapier-powered) bot that automatically posts to Twitter whenever
  someone signed up for the mentored sprint.

- Wrote about `PEP 581 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/>`_ to python-dev.
  So far, people seem supportive. This will be discussed at the language summit at PyCon US.

- Proposed that we `create the "Bug Triage" team on GitHub <https://discuss.python.org/t/proposal-create-bug-triage-team-on-github/992>`_.

- `Notified Python contributors <https://discuss.python.org/t/using-cla-assistant-for-python/990>`_
  that I plan to turn on `CLA assistant <https://cla-assistant.io/>`_ as our CLA enforcement.
  I'd like to see this done before I go on `OOOS <https://discuss.python.org/t/mariatta-will-be-ooos-out-of-open-source-starting-march-18-may-9th-2019/973>`_,
  and **especially** before the mentored sprint at PyCon US.

- Started reading all the anonymous feedback about PyCascades.

- The `Time Timer I ordered from Amazon <https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1102710078556131328>`_
  arrived. I plan on using this to timebox discussions at the upcoming Python
  language summit, so we don't go overtime. Because I really want to attend the
  PyCon staff dinner happening right afterwards.

- Interviewed about "things I'm up to in open source". Well, I'm in such weird
  and unique place right now; all I want to talk about is PEP 581. I hope the
  journalist finds PEP 581 exciting. üôÇ

- Details about OSI election hit slashdot. It was emotionally draining, and I
  started questioning the choices I made.

etc.
----

- Gossiped with internet friends.

- Called several movers to get quotes. We might just end up renting a big truck
  and move by ourselves.

- Tax season has started! üò± Collected all of my receipts and gave them to my
  accountant.

- Detox from Twitter üìµ

- There's still a big hole üï≥ on the ceiling of my living room.

- We got more snow and hail! ‚ùÑ Twice this week I had to scrape off ice from car
  that was parked outside. Sending kids to school was taking longer than usual.

- Feeling unwell (mentally). I've had several meltdowns earlier in the
  week. I think the stress from various things in my life are finally
  catching up, and as it turns out I'm still unable to manage my life accordingly.

- Took the kids to the bank and opened their own bank account. I showed them how
  to use the ATM. So now they have some place to stash their hong bao. üßß
  *"First step towards self independence!"*, as my husband said.

- Talked to our kids that they're vaccinated for measles, explained how
  shots/vaccination works, and told them they don't need to worry about getting
  sick.
