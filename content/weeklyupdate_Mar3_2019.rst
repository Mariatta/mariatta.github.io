Back from PyCascades, and trying to settle back to "normal". I'm not even sure
what is "normal" anymore..


PyCascades
----------

TL;DR: **BUSY!!** üòµ Thank you to all who came!! I'm especially happy not only
because I get to meet old friends, but also friends on Twitter and finally we met
in person üòù I'm sorry we didn't have much time to connect üò¢

- Merged Thea's `PR to the enhanced CoC hotline
  <https://github.com/Mariatta/enhanced-coc-hotline/pull/27>`_.
  SMS is now supported, and we tested the CoC Hotline and Texting!

- Helped with the pre-registration event, signed people up, and ate some tacos.

- I was a member of the Code of Conduct committee. We had several incidents.
  The committee will be publishing a transparency report in the coming weeks.
  Shout out to other CoC committee members: Thea, Amanda, Maelle, Russell, and Eloisa.
  I've learned so much from them.

- Gave a `lightning talk <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yvJKTGbbYCpMQ_CuZ-Vfvc_SiyuYmshLZwk8Q3FJ-xk/edit>`_
  about the `Mentored Sprint at PyCon US <https://us.pycon.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/>`_.

- I looked after PyCascades twitter account and hashtags. I missed out attending most
  talks, but thanks to all the live tweets, I felt like I was up to date!! It sounds like
  you all had great time at PyCascades, and I love reading about them! We
  were trending in Seattle!! Achievement unlocked!

- I gave the `closing remarks <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uROcwz_CZbuWvcPuzCeiFnB4Q6EHfBsDqiA21651yWQ/edit#slide=id.p>`_
  and appreciation.

- Impromptu photo shoot with `Veronica Hanus <https://twitter.com/veronica_hanus>`_.
  I love `all the photos <https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1100844919134908416>`_ she took!! üòç

- Formed the Tequila Think Tank was formed.

- I had way too much tequila than I'm willing to admit.

- I've prepared my own PyCascades post-mortem notes. The team will meet next week
  for the post-mortem.

- Sent out post conference survey. (Sorry for one little typo)

- Repurposed the PyCascades Code of Conduct hotline into the `PyCascades virtual
  head office hotline <https://github.com/Mariatta/enhanced-coc-hotline/pull/31>`_.
  Thanks Seb for this idea! Basically we all need a phone number for PyCascades
  but none of us wants to share our personal phone number. Thanks to Nexmo
  for providing us with credit!

- Sprinted and helped several people with their PRs.


Work
----

- Small bug fixes and readying for our product launch!

- Shout out to Doug Mahugh, who responded to `my desperate plea of help on twitter
  <https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1100923656446783488>`_! üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  Doug is a two-time PyCascades attendee. He shared me a photo of his laptop.
  It was shiny with F-string and PyCascades stickers!!  üíúüò≠

- Booked my flights to Zapier's summer retreat. Sadly, the retreat is happening
  on the same week of Python Core Sprint in London. I've thought about splitting
  time of half week wit Core Python team, and half week with Zapier, but I've
  decided that I want to prioritize my work for now. I'm sad to miss the sprint
  this year, but I'll be spending the week in the hometown of Prince: Minneapolis!

- Attended a D&I roundtable discussion. I'm really glad that we have this going
  at Zapier.


PyCon
-----

- Worked with ≈Åukasz and finalized the language summit `sign up forms
  <https://goo.gl/forms/pexfOGDjpV0BWMer2>`_.
  We announced to mailing lists, Discourse, Zulip, twitter, etc. Updated the `PyCon's website
  <https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/>`_
  about the language summit. Reached out to people who had inquired about it.

- Wrote to PSF Community mailing list about the mentored sprint.

Python and the community
------------------------

- I realized it was getting close to spring break, and therefore to my planned
  OOOS. So I wrote to Python committers about my `upcoming OOOS <https://discuss.python.org/t/mariatta-will-be-ooos-out-of-open-source-starting-march-18-may-9th-2019/973>`_.

- I'm a `candidate for OSI board of directors <https://wiki.opensource.org/bin/Main/OSI+Board+of+Directors/Board+Member+Elections/MariattaWijaya2019>`_.

- Opened an issue at `python-organizers/conferences <https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences/issues/89>`_.
  This was briefly discussed with David and Anthony from ReadTheDocs during PyCascades
  sprint.

- Responded to several emails.

- I'm honored to have been awarded `The PSF Community Service Award 2018 Q3
  <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-north-star-of-pycascades-core.html>`_.
  The blog post came out right before PyCascades about to begin, and it was
  all too overwhelming. Only now I'm able to digest this all. Thank you,
  Python community for this honor. I can do what I do only because you've
  been there for me.

- I now own mariatta.dev. Nothing to see there for now.

- Last week we made an offer to a new home, and it was accepted. So we've
  been super busy with paperwork, working with our realtor, bank, and accountant.
  üòµ I can't believe this! I'll be moving to a new place in a couple months.
  It has my DREAM KITCHEN!!!! If I ever need to quit tech, I'm going to start
  my own Youtube cooking channel right from that kitchen.

- A home restoration team came and made a big hole on the ceiling of my living
  room. üï≥ They will come back next week to complete the work.

- Continued practising guitar. We tried a new song: the Beatles' Let it Be.

- Took a nap on Saturday. And Sunday.
