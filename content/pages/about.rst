ðŸ™‹Hi!

co-organizer of `Vancouver PyLadies`_ and `PyCascades`_ conference.

I'm a Python Core Developer. I contribute to `Python documentation`_,
`Python Developer's Guide`_, `Python core workflow`_, and `Python.org`_. I help
maintain Core Python's GitHub bots: `bedevere`_ and `miss-islington`_.

My current big projects are: `PEP 581`_ and `black out`_.
