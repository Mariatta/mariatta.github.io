Weekly Updates
##############

:slug: weekly-updates

A ritual at `Zapier <https://zapier.com/>`_ (where I work) is everyone posts
a weekly Friday updates post to share progress for the week. Typically it
includes things we've accomplished this week, what we'll be doing next week,
and optionally an "unplugged" section where people share fun things they do outside of work.

The weekly updates are useful for various things, among them as reflection and
accountability. I wasn't doing great in writing my weekly updates at first,
(I've skipped some weeks) but I've made it a goal to myself to never miss
writing my weekly updates.

To help motivate myself, and because my weekly "unplugged from Zapier" are usually
related to Python and open source community, I figured why not open source my
updates?
