Work
----

- Wrapped up a task, tested, deployed. Lots of discussions with other team members.

- Some code cleanup. In one PR I removed 3000+ lines of code. It was quite
  satisfying! 😤

- Writing automation script.

- Sent out my monthly invoice to Zapier 🤑

Python and the community
------------------------

- Last Friday I received a number of error alerts for `bedevere-bot
  <https://github.com/python/bedevere/>`_. Initially I ignored these alerts
  because I was supposed to be on hiatus from open source. However after
  two days, errors were still continuing to happen, blocking the workflow.
  PRs couldn't be merged. So I spent some time figuring
  it out, read the logs, and finally `deployed the fix on Sunday
  <https://github.com/python/bedevere/pull/163>`_.

- Worked with Łukasz to finalize the lineup for `Python Language Summit
  <https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/>`_. Sent out notification
  emails. Product placement: I used Zapier to send out emails to 50 people
  (Google Sheets -> GMail integration)

- Worked with Nina, Tania, and Nikoleta for the `mentored sprint for diverse beginners
  <https://us.pycon.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/>`_. Created an `online
  resource in readthedocs <https://mentored-sprint-for-diverse-beginners.readthedocs.io/>`_.


etc

- I've been reading `Black Jack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Jack_(manga)>`_
  manga. And `Master Keaton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Keaton>`_.

- My husband has started packing 😅 He packed 3 boxes. 📦 Perhaps 50 more to go...
