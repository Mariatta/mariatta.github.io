## The Python Community

Python is not just code, but a community. The Python community members contribute in many ways and in many forms. 
The obvious ones are code contributions, by maintaining or contributing to the open
source library that you depend on. Other forms of contributions are in the form of documentation, tutorials, educational
content, bloggers, and public speakers. Other kind of contributions that are often unseen and not obvious are
community leaders who run your local Python meetups, and regional conferences.

As users of Python, we benefited from these contributions one way or the other. Other than you've already been using
Python for free to get paid and improve your life and career, I'm sure you've also gained experience by watching
conference talks, listening to Python podcasts, reading blog posts and newsletters.

Maybe you got a new job through connections you've made at a Python conference. Maybe you launched your public speaking
or devrel career by meeting community members at meetups.

It is only fair that we say thanks to the Python people, who have helped us in our Python journey.

There are many ways to say thanks to our favorite Python community member.

## Level 0: Actually say thanks to them

Obviously, just say thanks.

Say thanks to them when they released a new library version.

Say thanks when they scheduled a meetup/conference.

Say thanks when they posted a new blog post/tutorial/newsletter.

I'm sure you're already doing this anyway, so please continue doing it.

## Level 1: Say thanks in public

Don't keep things to yourself. Share the joy with your friends, colleagues, and your network.

By saying thanks in public, you're giving visibility to their work, and the recognition they deserve. You'll
also be helping to further amplify the impact of their contributions, helping their content reach more audience, helping
their tools and library be discovered and used by more people.

Found a useful library that helped you at work? Tell others about it. Ok, maybe you're already doing this by saying
"thanks to library X, it makes my work easy." Don't stop there! Be sure to mention their name: "Thanks to A who
maintains library X, it makes my work easy."

I also want to challenge you to be even more specific, like, "Thanks to contributor B who made the PR for feature Y,
it makes my work easy."

How can you find out who the contributor or maintainer is? Thankfully, because you are using open source libraries,
such info is also available out in the open. The challenge is we don't always know where to look for such info, or worse,
we take things for granted, and didn't bother finding out.

So here are some ways to find out who the maintainers/contributors are:

- Find the project's GitHub repository, look at the list of contributors and pull requests.
- Find the project's changelog/release notes (You're probably already reading this anyway!)
- Go to the project's PyPI page, the maintainers are usually listed there

Do this for community contributions too! Instead of saying "That Python conference was great, you should go next time!",
say "Thanks to the program chair X who selected great talks for the conference.", or "Thanks to speaker Y who gave this
talk about Z".

It doesn't take a lot of time to write up a such messages on your social media posts. Plus, you'll look cool and
well-traveled by showing off that you just went to a conference, or that you just use some cool new library. Win-win.

## Level 2: Show your support

Show that you're interested in their work, that you want them to continue maintaining the library, you want them
to give more talks, or you want them to put the next year's conference. Don't wait until they finished doing all that
before you say thanks!

You can show that you support them by subscribing to their newsletter/blog/YouTube channel, or by following them
on social media.

## Level 3: Contribute to their project/ Volunteer at the community

Don't just use their library. Contribute back. Find their GitHub repo, check the contributing guide, learn
their workflow, and start contributing.

Some projects can be picky about their contributing workflow, for example some
projects absolutely want you to first create a ticket. Therefore, do spend time reading their contributing guide, maybe
lurk in their discussion forum, and learn how other existing contributors do it.

Don't just attend conferences/meetup. Offer to help and volunteer.

But offering to help can be tricky. There are so
many things that event organizers do behind the scene. Each role has specific requirements in terms of the level
of commitment needed.

When offering to help with the community events, like meetup/conferences, don't just say "I want to help, tell me how".
Offering to help is appreciated, but at the same time, it gives them work because now they have to figure out what
roles to give to you. 

Here's the trick to make it easier for them to accept your help!

Instead of saying "Tell me how to help", I recommend you be super specific about the kind of help you want/can do,
and additionally be honest about your availability. So you can say things like, "I want to help with program review,
because I have experience giving talks and writing good proposals. I can be available during month X.".

Giving them
these details and showing that you can commit to the volunteer role, will make it easier for them to decide whether
to onboard you into their volunteer team or not.

In order for you to successfully offer your help, you'll need to invest
a bit more time in understanding how their community work.

Just like code contribution, where you need to spend time
learning their contributor's workflow before actually contributing,
you would need to spend time learning more about the community, before you can start volunteering to the community.


## Level 4: Contribute money

Don't have time to actually contribute/volunteer? You can give money instead!

Sponsor your favorite open source maintainer on GitHub, OpenCollective, become a Patron on their Patreon, buy them coffee,
send them PayPal, etc. If you couldn't find such info, then ask them. Even if they end up saying, that no they can't
accept monetary payment from you, at least you'll make them feel valued.

If you have a favorite Python conference, be sure to check their sponsorship prospectus, and tell your employer to
sponsor the event.

## Level 5: Nominate them for Awards

There are many awards in the Python and open source community. I would especially recommend that you recognize those
outside of North America, those underrepresented in tech industry, those from marginalized community.
For them, receiving awards from well-established organizations could really improve their career.

So not only you'll be showing your gratitude and admiration to your
favorite Python person, you could directly make an impact in their life. When they don't need
to worry about their career, they'll have more time to continue maintaining the library you depend on, or continue
running the events you enjoyed so much.

After all they've done for the community, I'm sure you agree that they deserve to be recognized. 

Maybe you're thinking, this person is so admirable, surely someone else had nominated them for the award, surely
they have received the award already. Well don't just guess or assume. Verify that by actually checking the list
of past award recipient to see if they're there. If not, go nominate them now.

- [Microsoft OSS Fund](https://github.com/microsoft/foss-fund)

If you work at such companies, be sure to nominate some Python people.

## Go thank the Python People!

Thanks for reading! Now go think of at least one Python people in your life, (like, a blogger, open source maintainer,
speaker, local meetup organizer, conference organizer, podcaster, etc), and thank them by doing one or more of the
above!

If you can't think of anyone, perhaps it's because you haven't joined the community.
So go attend your local Python meetups or look for upcoming Python conferences. You can find a well-maintained
list of Python conferences on this repository: https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences
