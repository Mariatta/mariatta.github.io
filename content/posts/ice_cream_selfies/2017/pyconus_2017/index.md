## What's the Scoop PDX

After giving my talk, [Dial M For Mentor]({{<ref "/posts/talks/dial-m-for-mentor.md">}}), I was feeling quite stressed out.
My friend Jeff asked if there's anything that would make me feel better, and
I said "I wanna go get ice cream". So we went to this place that he knew about.

At that time, I didn't consider Ice Cream Selfie to be a "thing" yet, but
I think this is when it becomes a real "tradition".

Sadly, "What's the Scoop" closed their doors in 2022.
