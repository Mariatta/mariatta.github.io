## Icy Dot Wine

I was just walking around in Florence, having given my talk at two conferences
in the same week: [PyCon Italy and DjangoCon Europe 2017]({{<ref "/posts/talks/dial-m-for-mentor.md">}}).

At that time, Ice cream selfie isn't quite a ritual yet, so I didn't even
know which shop this was.

After many years, I tracked down the shop name! This was from [Icy Dot Wine](https://www.facebook.com/AMRSA2016/).
