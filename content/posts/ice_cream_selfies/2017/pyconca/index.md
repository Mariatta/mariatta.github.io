## La Cabane De Danny

PyCon Canada happened in November, in Montreal. It was freezing cold outside,
but didn't stop me from getting ice cream. I found La Cabane De Danny, and they
make ice cream with bubble waffle cone. So fun! The matcha ice cream was real
good!

Unfortunately this shop has since closed down.
