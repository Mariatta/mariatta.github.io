## Cathy's Gourmet Ice Cream Sandwiches

PyCon US 2019 was a busy one for me. I gave a talk, a tutorial, and also ran the first
Mentored Sprints with Nina Zakharenko and Tania Allard,
AND co-chaired the Python Language Summit for the first time ðŸ˜µ (I ended up co-charing it for 4 years).

I went to Cathy's Gourmet Ice Cream Sandwiches. The ice cream sandwich was really yummy! ðŸ˜‹

I'm sad to hear that this place has since closed down.
