## Hammond's Gourmet Ice Cream

It was fun visiting San Diego for DjangoCon US 2018. I gave my talk [Don't Be a Robot; Build the Bot]({{<ref "/posts/talks/dont-be-a-robot-build-the-bot">}}).
I think it was well received ðŸ˜Š

This was also a special travel trip, because, well it happens that my husband also
needed to travel for work at the same time, so we don't have anyone to look after
our two kids. I ended up taking my kids with me to the conference.

Thanks to DjangCon US for accommodating, and also helped with childcare situation
so I could give a keynote at this conference.

After my talk, I took my kids to get ice cream at [Hammond's Gourmet Ice Cream](https://www.hammondsgourmet.com/).
