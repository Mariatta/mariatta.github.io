## Angela's Organic Ice Cream Petaluma


One perk of being a keynote at North Bay Python is you get to headline and
have your name up on the marquee ‚≠êÔ∏è It's really cool!

Thanks North Bay Python for inviting me! I get to immortalize it in my ice
cream selfie üòù

Little did I know that I would return to the conference, and back to 
[Angela's Organic Ice Cream](https://www.angelasicecream.com/)
[five years later]({{<ref "/posts/talks/pep_talk.md">}})!
