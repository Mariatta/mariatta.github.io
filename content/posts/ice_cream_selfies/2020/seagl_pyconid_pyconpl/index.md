It was 2020. I joined so many virtual conferences, and at one point, I was a
speaker at three different conferences all in one same weekend.

2020 was also, a challenging time, I didn't get to go out a lot. I didn't even
get to do my Ice cream selfie after the conference.

Finally, on new year's eve, we decided to celebrate and go out. While
in Robson Street, we stopped by a Korean grocery store and my kids saw some 
boba milk tea ice cream bar for sale. So I decided to do my ice cream selfie at
that time.
