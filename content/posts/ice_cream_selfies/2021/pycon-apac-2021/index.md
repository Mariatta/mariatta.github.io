## Bella Gelateria

I gave a keynote speech at PyCon APAC 2021, which was hosted by PyCon Thailand.
This was an online event, so I didn't actually go to Thailand for this. However,
I found an ice cream flavour that represent Thailand: Thai Coconut Milk Gelato 
from Bella Gelateria!

[Bella Gelateria](https://www.bellagelateria.com/) has one of the best ice cream in Vancouver, they've won many awards!
