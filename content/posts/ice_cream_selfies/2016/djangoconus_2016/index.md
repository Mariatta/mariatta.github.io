## Capogiro Gelato Artisans

My first ever [conference talk]({{<ref "/posts/talks/making-the-most-out-of-code-reviews.md">}}), and my first ever Ice Cream Selfie! The rest
is history.

Trio Gelato from Capogiro Gelato: Cappucino, Pistachio, and Bacio.

While my public speaking and ice cream selfies continues, sadly Capogiro Gelato Artisans
has since closed down. ðŸ˜¢
