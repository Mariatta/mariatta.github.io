## Core Dev Story

This video game lets you play as a CPython core developer. You can recruit more core devs to join
your project, develop new features, fix bugs, write documentation, and more.

As you develop new features, you can gain more fame. But new features also introduces new
bugs to the codebase.
The amount of fame and bugs gained depend on the skills of the core developers you
have in your  team.

You can build up your fame by developing more features. Sometimes recruiting other core developers also brings more
fame, especially if news about the recruitment is covered in a blog post or news.

Some core developers are quite famous on their own, and you can't
recruit them unless your project is already famous enough.

In this game, developing new features won't bring you money, but it looks like there is an option
to Freelance.

## How can you play this game?

I don't know when this video game will be released.

If you like the idea of this game, be sure to let the creator know! It might speed up the development, but
I can't promise anything. It looks like a copycat wannabe of
"[Game Dev Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Dev_Story)" from Kairosoft.

## Hire a real-life Python core developer

In the meantime, you can already recruit and hire real-life Python core developers. Some of us
are consultants, freelancers, and some are open to work. Talk to me about it.
