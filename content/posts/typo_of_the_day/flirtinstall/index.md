I was trying to install a library using [flit](https://flit.pypa.io).

The correct command is `flit install`.

Flit is a simple way to package and publish Python packages on PyPI. You can read
up about it in the docs.

They also have a "[Why use Flit](https://flit.pypa.io/en/latest/rationale.html)" section.
