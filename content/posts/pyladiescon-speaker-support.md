## Speak at PyLadiesCon

[PyLadiesCon CFP](https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2024/cfp) is now open until September 15, 2024,
and I would love to support you in submitting your talk.

- Perhaps you never gave a talk before, and unsure if speaking for you?
- Perhaps you want to give a talk, but don't think you're experienced enough?
- Perhaps you have a talk idea, but don't know how to turn it into a proposal?
- Perhaps you tried submitting talks before, but always get rejected and feeling discouraged?

I've been through all of the above before myself, and I know how you feel. Having a supportive community, and having
mentors who were willing to give personalized 1:1 feedback, have helped me overcome my fears and self-doubt, and be a
better speaker. The PyLadies community is here to support you.

While I can't guarantee that your talk will get accepted, I can support, offer advice/feedback, and cheer you in your
public speaking journey.

## Book a time with me

If you're a PyLadies member (from anywhere), or you identify as a PyLady,
and you'd like some support with your proposal, then you're invited to book a time with me using this link: https://calendly.com/mariatta_/30-mins-chat.


<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->
<div class="calendly-inline-widget" data-url="https://calendly.com/mariatta_/30-mins-chat" style="min-width:320px;height:700px;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js" async></script>
<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->


For now until September 15, I'm opening up my weekends in my booking link above in case weekends work better for you.

If you can't find a good meeting time using the link above, please contact me via email, and we'll work something out:
mariatta at pyladies dot com.

## How you can support other PyLadies

If you're an experienced speaker and want to see more PyLadies speaking at conferences, I encourage you to offer your
mentorship to the PyLadies that you know. Often, such help and advice are better received if coming from someone they
already know, like yourself, instead of from a stranger like me.

Sometimes it's hard for us to ask for help, and we don't always know who can we ask for help from.
By being explicit and letting others know that you're available to help, it will lower that barrier.

If you're also offering your own speaker mentorship/speaker support sessions, let me know ([via Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@mariatta)), and I'll update
this post with link to yours.

If you know of PyLadies in your community who have done interesting work with Python but are not yet a public speaker,
contact them and encourage them to start their public speaking journey, and let them know about this speaking opportunity.
Check the [PyLadiesCon CFP Outreach Kit](https://conference.pyladies.com/news/cfp-outreach-kit/)
to learn more on our outreach tips.

You can also help by spreading news about the conference by sharing on social media, talk about it on your next
meetup/company meeting/newsletter/short videos, by [sponsoring](https://conference.pyladies.com/sponsors/) the event,
or by [volunteering](https://conference.pyladies.com/volunteer/).
