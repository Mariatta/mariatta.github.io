I missed writing last week's update because I've been on vacation.

Work
----

- Last week I shipped a thing.

- Looking into bug fixing this week and next week. Writing script to automate stuff.

Python and the community
------------------------

I started `OOOS <https://discuss.python.org/t/mariatta-will-be-ooos-out-of-open-source-starting-march-18-may-9th-2019/973>`_
last week, so there shouldn't be anything interesting in this section for the next month.

- Started going through language summit sign ups and reviewing the topic proposals.

- Correspondence with Python Steering Council about `PEP 581 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0588/>`_.
  They said it should be split up into two PEPs.

- Reserved `PEP 588 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0588/>`_ because I think
  `88 is a lucky number <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/88_(number)>`_ ðŸ˜‡

- Open Source Initiative run-off election closed early this week. I came
  `real close <https://opensource.org/node/976>`_ but in the end I was not chosen.

- Received three invitations to give keynote at conferences. I declined two of
  them because time and space wouldn't permit. Still considering the last one.

- Published the next `PyLadies Vancouver event <https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/events/259859957/>`_,
  where I get to give practise run of my `intro to aiohttp PyCon tutorial <https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/68/>`_, which
  is now full btw.


etc
---

- Spent a week in CancÃºn. I got sunburnt, but totally worth it. I ate lots of
  tacos and consumed lots of tequila. Feeling recharged now. ðŸ’ª

- We baked gingerbread cookies. Kids found my `one-of-a-kind emoji cookiecutter
  <https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1111479352649121792>`_,
  so we put it to good use ðŸ˜…

- Started scheming the move to our new home, getting home insurance quotes,
  looking into kids' piano and karate lessons closer to the new home.
