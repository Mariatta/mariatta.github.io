Python and the community
------------------------

- Answered several emails for PyLadies.

- I volunteered myself to be an admin of PyLadies ðŸ˜³ You can now reach me at
  mariatta at pyladies dot com ðŸ“§ (Thanks Lynn and Ernest for the help in
  getting this set up). With my new PyLadies admin power, I can help create new PyLadies
  chapters. A new chapter created this week was Montevideo PyLadies in Uruguay.
  Of course, when I said I'll do things, I really mean I'm creating bots to do
  all of these. PyLadies have lots of bots now! ðŸ˜„

  the fund! The payout is once a month, and only if we have at least 100$ balance
  to be paid out. And yes, I will be reporting this in my income tax.
