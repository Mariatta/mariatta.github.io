Work
----

A shorter work week, because of Good Friday statutory holiday.

- Ran a script that spins up the pages for requested Zapier integrations.
  An example of such page is `this page for requesting Facebook Messenger
  integration in Zapier <https://zapier.com/apps/facebook-messenger/integrations>`_.
  Generated about 600+ of such page in one script.

- Wrote a draft Zapier engineering blog post.


Python and the community
------------------------

- Discussed with Andrew Svetlov about our PyCon tutorial. We've created `the
  repo <https://github.com/asvetlov/us-pycon-2019-tutorial>`_ and
  `online documentation <https://us-pycon-2019-tutorial.readthedocs.io/>`_ in
  readthedocs.

- Spent most of my free time working on my portion of the tutorial.

- Some administrative work for the mentored sprint and Python Language Summit.
