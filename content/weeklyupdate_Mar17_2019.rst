Getting ready for spring break vacation! Tying up loose ends before I go on
`OOOS <https://discuss.python.org/t/mariatta-will-be-ooos-out-of-open-source-starting-march-18-may-9th-2019/973>`_.

Work
----

- Working with `Iterable API <https://api.iterable.com/api/docs/>`_. Wrote to
  their tech support.


Python and the community
------------------------

- Touchbase about CLA-assistant with Ernest. At this point we think that my job
  is done, and everything else is on Ernest and core devs. No pressure, but I
  want this happening before PyCon begins! 🙏🏻😣

- I noticed a regional Python community is putting out their first conference,
  and their speakers are all white men. 💔 Hurts to see this still happening
  in 2019. I don't even know what to say anymore. `I've said what I had to say
  about this exact same situation <https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/987450414298685440>`_
  **in 2018**.

- Victor noticed that miss-islington wasn't working as expected. I found out that
  was cherry-picker v 1.3.0 was buggy, so I spent time working on it.
  Released `cherry-picker v 1.3.1 <https://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker/>`_ as
  bug fix. Thanks to `Sviatoslav <https://github.com/webknjaz>`_ for reviewing!

- Various routine maintenance for `cherry-picker <https://github.com/python/core-workflow/tree/master/cherry_picker>`_
  and `miss-islington <https://github.com/python/miss-islington>`_.

- Merged various PRs. Nothing exciting, mostly typo fixes.

- Administrative work for the next PyLadies Vancouver event.

- It me in `Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/women-running-for-the-open-source-initiative-face-online-harassment-2019-3>`_!

etc
---

- My guitar instructor showed me the `Chordify <https://chordify.net/>`_ app.
  Then we found the chords to Savage Garden's `Truly, Madly, Deeply <https://youtu.be/WQnAxOQxQIU>`_,
  and we played it together. It was real fun! I asked if we can try `To The Moon and Back
  <https://youtu.be/HCm6gRHINqA>`_ next time 😛

- Found the YouTube playlist for `Gara-Gara <https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gara-Gara>`_,
  an Indonesian sitcom from the 90s. Started watching episodes 1-4.

- Played `Pocket Academy <http://kairopark.jp/android/en/>`_ on my phone.

- While on the way to register our kids to their new school, we got stuck in traffic
  for more than two hours. From the internet I found out that there was a crash
  and `a vehicle got on fire <https://www.tricitynews.com/news/f-350-bursts-into-blames-on-lougheed-hwy-1.23665719>`_.
  When the traffic cleared, the school was already closed. So I have to return back
  after spring break.

- Got sick just when the weekend started. 🤧😷🤒🤕 I was pretty much bedridden yesterday.
  Feeling better today.
