&lt;li&gt;It was quite a year! Not quite like 2017, but quite remarkable in its own way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of things happened. Mostly good things. Some bad things, but definitely
it was a net positive year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still quite a busy year, but I feel mostly good about it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It was quite a year! Not quite like 2017, but quite remarkable in its own way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of things happened. Mostly good things. Some bad things, but definitely
it was a net positive year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still quite a busy year, but I feel mostly good about it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some mistakes, but proud of a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="starting-new-at-zapier"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting new at Zapier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My start date at Zapier was about two weeks before PyCascades. Perhaps, I should've waited until after PyCascades wrapped up before starting a
new job. I found myself needing more time to adjust and ramp up to my new work
environment, new team, new responsibilities, new everything. It took longer than
I'd like before I really feel like I'm getting a hang of my new job. I'm grateful
that Zapier has been understanding and accommodating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycascades-2018"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCascades 2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put out PyCascades! It was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;! It was amazing! I'm really proud of it.
I'm proud of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2018.pycascades.com/schedule/"&gt;all of our speakers&lt;/a&gt;.
I'm proud to have hosted &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2018.pycascades.com/talks/bdfl-python-3-retrospective/"&gt;the creator of Python&lt;/a&gt;.
I'm proud that we filled the theatre. I'm proud that our speakers got the audience
they deserve. I'm proud that our community is enriched by the talks we chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the one thing that I'm most proud of, is our organizing team. Who would have
thought that somehow, this team of people with different backgrounds,
coming from different countries, living in different cities, somehow, &lt;em&gt;we made it work&lt;/em&gt;.
Since day one, the PyCascades team has done nothing but completely support, respect, and trust
one another. I can't ask for a better team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seb, Bryan, Eric, Alan, and Don, I feel lucky that somehow you've all included me
into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conferences"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conferences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than PyCascades, I went to three other conferences: PyCon US, DjangoCon, and
North Bay Python. I presented a tutorial and a talk at PyCon US, as well as a couple
talks at Python Language Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm real honored to have been invited to as keynote speakers at DjangoCon and
North Bay Python. Both of these communities now have special places in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received four other invitations to give keynote at conferences, from faraway places, places
I've never been. But unfortunately I had to decline them. Not because
I didn't want to speak there, but I just couldn't take any more time away from my
family and my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="travels"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Travels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't get to visit many different countries this year, but I visited many new
places in the US. For Zapier-related travels, I visited Hilton Head Island,
Phoenix, and Chattanooga. For Python-related events, I visited Cleveland, Bellevue,
Petaluma, and San Diego. We spent a week in Cancun for spring break. I went on a
solo road trip in the summer. I drove around Oregon and Washington, I went to Mount
Hood and Mount St. Helens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="it-me"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It me!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/after-years-of-abusive-e-mails-the-creator-of-linux-steps-aside"&gt;an interview with Noam Cohen from The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;.
I was quite nervous about it initially. I felt kinda silly about it now, but I had
to admit, I didn't know much about The New Yorker, so I had to ask a couple American friends
of its reputation. My excuse was that I'm an immigrant and I don't follow
American media. Anyways, (and I feel lucky to have them as friends because they didn't judge!),
they all said that it is a great opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't even know why I had to be nervous about it. I guess this is something
I can brag about to my future descendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="black-out"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Black_out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working on a new side project, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mariatta/black_out"&gt;black_out&lt;/a&gt;.
It was very much inspired by my experience developing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington"&gt;miss-islington&lt;/a&gt;.
Black_out is a GitHub bot that runs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; on pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've learned many new things by building black_out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make black_out happen, I needed a new feature to be implemented in gidgethub,
that is the ability to be authenticated using JSON web token. Because
I wanted this feature in gidgethub, I ended up &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brettcannon/gidgethub/pull/62"&gt;writing the PR&lt;/a&gt; myself.
Short story is, this is done, and it's been included since gidgethub 3.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little longer story: writing the tests and maintaining 100% coverage
was quite an adventure! There was one part where I just didn't know how to write the test case for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the test that I started writing (see picture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/gidgethub_test_case.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to come up with a test case for an async generator &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;gh.getiter()&lt;/tt&gt;, where
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ValueError&lt;/tt&gt; is raised if both &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;oauth_token&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;jwt&lt;/tt&gt; are passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I wrote it initially, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;coverage&lt;/tt&gt; reported that there was no coverage there, and
I didn't know what I needed to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I contacted the maintainers of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;coverage&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;asyncio&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pytest&lt;/tt&gt; for advice,
in case they've come across similar situation before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ned commented that it seemed odd to use &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pass&lt;/tt&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then experimented doing it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
    gh.getiter(&amp;quot;/fake&amp;quot;, {&amp;quot;extra&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot;}, oauth_token=&amp;quot;my oauth token&amp;quot;, jwt=&amp;quot;json web token&amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it resulted in an error: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Failed: DID NOT RAISE &amp;lt;class 'ValueError'&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then suggested to &amp;quot;just use nocover pragma&amp;quot;. Yury suggested using
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pytest.fail&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pass&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brettcannon/gidgethub/blob/b260304d3feec022c9890e12b5bdd6bff4c51029/gidgethub/test/test_abc.py#L250-L254"&gt;end result&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
    async for _ in gh.getiter(&amp;quot;/fake&amp;quot;, {&amp;quot;extra&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot;}, oauth_token=&amp;quot;my oauth token&amp;quot;, jwt=&amp;quot;json web token&amp;quot;)
        pytest.fail(&amp;quot;Unreachable&amp;quot;)  # pragma: no cover
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-first-pep-and-second"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My First PEP (and second)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a PEP for the first time: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt; - Using GitHub Issues for CPython. I've
been working on it for some time since earlier this year, but before I got the
chance to announce it, Guido announced his retirement as Python BDFL. I'm happy
for him. His retirement also meant that there was no one who could pronounce
on PEP 581.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then wrote &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8011/"&gt;PEP 8011&lt;/a&gt; - Python
Governance Model Lead by Trio of Pythonistas, co-authored
with Barry Warsaw. PEP 8011 was not top choice among core developers, and I'm fine with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-things-to-be-proud-of"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other things to be proud of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/blurb_it"&gt;blurb_it&lt;/a&gt;, and learned how to
use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp-jinja2"&gt;aiohttp-jinja2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp-session"&gt;aiohttp-session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major improvements to miss-islington include: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/51"&gt;automerge backport PRs&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/146"&gt;automerge any PR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/59"&gt;improved test coverage&lt;/a&gt;, and finally dropping &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;requests&lt;/tt&gt; dependency
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/186/files"&gt;using pure gidgethub and aiohttp to make requests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started learning to play guitar, fulfilling a lifelong dream of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I facilitated and provided speaker mentorship during PyCascades CFP period. Several
of the mentees got their proposals accepted. The proposals were great to begin with.
I'm just proud to take part in their success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="disappointment"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disappointment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my oldest child was born, I kinda promised myself that I'm going to be a
a good parent and not miss any of their school performances and sporting events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day that both of my children performing in their school musical, an Alice
in Wonderland production, I was not at home. Instead, I was at Python Language
Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, it seemed like an obvious choice. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; the language summit was
more important than my children's school performance. That's what I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been feeling guilty about missing their school performance. I can only hope to
somehow make it up to them in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="years-ago"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;20 years ago ...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;content &amp;amp; trigger warning: trauma / PTSD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Phoenix, I met up with an old classmate. A friend I haven't seen for more than
20 years. I haven't seen her since maybe junior high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things she asked, was if I remember &amp;quot;the riot&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it strange that, after not meeting for more than 20 years, this was
one of the first things she asked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess, the riot affected her too. Whether it affected her in the same way it
affected me, I don't know. I don't even realize how it affected me until quite
recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; riot. &lt;em&gt;Kerusuhan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Indonesian people old enough to remember, the riot means one thing: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia"&gt;the
riots of May 1998&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember it. I don't remember how it started, or how it ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember parts of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... the time when myself, my brothers, my parents and grandparents, we were
all gathered in our kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember, being told to pick up one of the kitchen knives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... being told not to be afraid. To be &lt;em&gt;ready&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the rioters came in, &lt;em&gt;stab&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... &lt;em&gt;holding the knife&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... &lt;em&gt;being afraid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They never managed to come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several days, we were on the run. One of my uncles' friend sheltered
us in his house. The grownups told us that we'd be safe there. We'd be safe there,
because it is a Muslim's house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't understand what was happening at the time. I didn't even understand why
we'd be safe in a Muslim's house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I remember ... feeling confused. And betrayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The riot? Yeah, I remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd rather forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mental-breakdown"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mental Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;content &amp;amp; trigger warning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of good things happened this year, and yet, I got hit with a wave of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mental health had been slowly deteriorating since ... some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does it even matter when it started?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been going on for a while, and I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; what was happening. Yet I ignored the
signs. I kept telling myself, that I can handle it. &lt;em&gt;I've been through this before&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can take care of myself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that ... I wasn't actually taking care of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF8IJsxeNLM"&gt;I was flying so high. But I needed to fall.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself in the darkest place I've ever been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during my road trip that I realized just how dangerous it was for me to
be alone with only my thoughts. My thoughts wandered deep into dark places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I shouldn't be behind the wheels!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I caught myself with those dark thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I hated myself for thinking those thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thoughts keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it went on ... and on ... in cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took ... &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, to try to pull myself back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY7K4uBV4Wc"&gt;The monster you were running from is the monster in you.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't been seeing my therapist for some time, but I've started seeing her again.
My doctor prescribed antidepressant medication. It took several trials, but we
found the medication that works. It comes with some side effects, but, at least,
I'm a functioning human being again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="managing-identities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing Identities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, I've been finding it increasingly difficult to manage all
of my different identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My roles and responsibilities as a parent, are quite different than the roles
and responsibilities as an employee, a conference organizer, a meetup organizer,
a Python core developer, an open source contributor, or a speaker, each of these roles
has different responsibilities and priorities. Sometimes, there is overlap. Sometimes,
there's contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't actually always know, which hat I'm wearing at any given time.
I don't always know, which hat do people see when they see me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that I've picked the right hat at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I always know, which hat is the right hat to wear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And do I still get to be just &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt;? What am I? &lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; am I? Who do I want to be?
What do I want to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still trying to figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="looking-forward"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that I've done this year, everything I've accomplished, I didn't do it on my own.
I received lots of help, support, and encouragement from various people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel ... lucky, that I have all of these friends. I don't take this for granted. I
worry that my luck will run out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's not worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 is now in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 is here now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds cliché, but I want to workout more and actually use the gym membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to keep up learning to play guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want for PEP 581 to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to visit at least one new country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to work on more GitHub bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lots of ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt kind of guilty at first. I was worried if my non-activity would mean
that other Python core devs will have to pick up the slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's give more credit to the core devs! Python has flourished for 20+ years
without my involvement. One month without me is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-still-did-some-volunteering"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I still did some volunteering&lt;/strong&gt; 😥&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these I sort of anticipated, many were unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Released cherry_picker v1.1.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had offered to help Andrew Svetlov with building a GitHub bot similar to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington"&gt;miss-islington&lt;/a&gt;, but for maintaining
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp"&gt;aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the work
needed to be done is to make cherry_picker customizable for other projects.
Andrew had made the necessary code changes, but there was one small bug.
All I needed to do was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/pull/233"&gt;review the PR&lt;/a&gt;,
approve it, and publish the fix to PyPI. It didn't take
too much of my time, so I was quite happy to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadowed Larry and Barry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound cryptic, but I'll leave it at that for now. I'm also not quite
sure how it came to be, but this was something the BDFL asked me
to do. Who am I to say no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organized a PyLadies Vancouver meetup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping my co-organizers could take care of this for me, and I wished I
didn't have to be involved. But we were having trouble finding a sponsor who would
host our April meetup. (I will rant about this in detail some other time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached out to at least five companies, and even tried booking a free meeting room
at Vancouver Public Library. Our requests were either denied or ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked other meetup organizers and several Python friends in town for help. In
the end, we pushed the event to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/events/249657234/"&gt;May&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/CiscoSecurity"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; stepped up to host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got myself invited to yet another community Slack channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to our difficulty with finding a meetup venue, the experience
prompted me to reach out to the other meetup organizers in town. One group
I talked to called themselves the Gastown Gang. Previously, they had lured me in with
promises of pasta. 🍝😋&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No pasta yet, but we had been talking about a new initiative for shared
resources among the local meetup communities in Vancouver,
how things can be more transparent and open, and how the different communities
can help and support each other. Somehow this ended with me joining a new community
Slack team. 😛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volunteered to write the docs for PEP 557: Data Classes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue32216"&gt;volunteered&lt;/a&gt; to do it a couple
months ago, but never got around doing anything. After a gentle ping from an
eager member of the community, I emailed Eric and Raymond to see if we could
sprint on this at PyCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I engaged with the community, on Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok maybe &lt;em&gt;engaged&lt;/em&gt; was not the right word. More like, ... &lt;em&gt;provoked&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expressed my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/987450414298685440"&gt;extreme disappointment&lt;/a&gt;
to the community. I knew the risks and the repercussions for speaking up about
diversity issues. But I did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the twitter broke. I mean, the twitter &lt;em&gt;on my phone&lt;/em&gt; broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having to block three people, I deleted the app for the rest of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read up about PEP 572&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Python core devs told me about this PEP, so I read some of
the python-dev emails about it. &lt;em&gt;Keeping personal opinions to myself&lt;/em&gt;. 🤐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-really-did-take-time-off"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I really DID take time off!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than Andrew's PR, I didn't review any other pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did not read any mailing list emails, except that one thread about PEP 572.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did not follow any issues in the bug tracker, except for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue3692"&gt;bpo-3692&lt;/a&gt;. But that was raised at work, so I don't
consider it as volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read Twitter only for my own notifications, mentions, and direct messages,
up until the weekend where my twitter broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did I do for my own me time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put in extra effort for my work at Zapier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a couple new features shipped! 🌮 They're documented
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/partner-api/#paging-through-results-using-limit-and-offset"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/shared-zaps-test-trigger/#embed-widget-faq"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. 😄
I'm working on a new feature, wanted by several partners. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netflix and ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤭 Eh, ... I watched a lot of shows on Netflix: All 3 seasons of Hannibal, Lucky
Number Slevin, and Troy: Fall of a City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Played Ramen Sensei on my phone&lt;/strong&gt; 🍜&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still under the delusion that I can successfully run a ramen shop if I ever
need to leave tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Went to my oldest son's first piano recital&lt;/strong&gt; 🎹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did great! 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worked on my GitHub Bot tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent two weekend afternoons to work on the tutorial. While I open-sourced
the  material, I don't count this as a &lt;em&gt;volunteer&lt;/em&gt; work since I'll be getting paid
for it at PyCon. Thanks to Brett who reviewed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigated if we could get a pet turtle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not tell my kids about this. After one afternoon of reading how to care
for a pet turtle, I realized I don't really want additional responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watched My Little Pony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My kids are into My Little Pony these days. Not something I'm familiar with. I'm
still learning all the ponies' name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did my taxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procrastinated doing it until pretty much the final day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="stuff-i-wanted-to-do-but-didn-t"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stuff I wanted to do, but didn't&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had been working on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/pull/3306"&gt;pull request for Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. I was planning
to find some time to finish it up, but didn't. 😥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been wanting to do at least some kind of cooking, baking, try out new recipe,
or at least make a batch of handmade noodles. None of that happened. 😕&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My review was requested for a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/pull/238"&gt;bugfix PR&lt;/a&gt;
to cherry_picker. I still haven't looked at it. 😔&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="happiness"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happiness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I received a happiness packet. Thanks Anna. 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Met up with my friends &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/986368161690759168"&gt;Seb and Dan&lt;/a&gt;.
We chatted about the community, about PyCon, and, of course, about how awesome f-strings are.
I also got Dan to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/986360574450651136"&gt;autograph&lt;/a&gt; my copy of his
book! 🤩&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received compliments about miss-islington and my GitHub Bot tutorial.
Thanks &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/nicoddemus/status/980963184189329408"&gt;Bruno&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/webology/status/985167199043235842"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;. 😊&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Found out that my tutorial at PyCon is now full! 😳️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thankful for the supportive Python community. 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-now"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss getting involved in open source, and being part of the community. But I
have other priorities for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still wanting a break from contributing to open source for another month,
except when I'm at PyCon for the sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will however, start getting involved in my local Python community again.
I need to follow up with Gastown Gang, and start planning the next PyLadies Vancouver
meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so looking forward to PyCon! Can't wait for my next ice cream selfie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="things-to-improve"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to improve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past month still felt busier than I wanted to. I'm still thinking up better
ways to do this. 😥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Gmail filters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to adjust the email filters several times to get it right. I think
it is still not optimal. Some emails from GitHub and b.p.o were still going through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some important emails got missed, because the sender uses an email system that always
include the word &amp;quot;unsubscribe&amp;quot;. 🤷🏻‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete twitter on my phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have done it from the get go. I should not even bother with
checking my mentions or direct messages. It got me into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O-O-OS autoreply GitHub bot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking it might be cool to have my own out-of-open source autoreply GitHub
bot. For example if someone mentions me or requested review from me, the bot can
respond on my behalf and let people know that I won't get to it for a while,
so they can find someone else. But I'm worried it'll just add noise to the thread.
More design is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a different month&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll definitely do this again next year. Question is, which month? 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm learning now that the months before and during PyCon are busy times of the year for
a Python core developer. Same as any month where there's a scheduled release it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it be so irresponsible if I choose to be off during those  months?
And do I need to co-ordinate with other core devs so we don't all go on a
break at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is this so complicated?&lt;/em&gt; 🙃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What a year. There might not be another year quite like this one for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of highlights, but some low points too. Net positive, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been ... busy. I want to be less busy in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January, my only wish for this year was to …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2017"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a year. There might not be another year quite like this one for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of highlights, but some low points too. Net positive, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been ... busy. I want to be less busy in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January, my only wish for this year was to get my talk accepted at PyCon US.
&lt;em&gt;That would be this year's highlight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, a lot of things happened. Mostly good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing all of these down, as a therapy for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycascades"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCascades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got an email from my friend Seb one morning, talked about organizing a Python
conference in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't think twice before saying yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just thought that a Python conference in this part of the world will be great
for the growing Python community here. And it wasn't going to happen on its own.
A person wouldn't be able to do it alone. But a group of people all sharing
the same ideals? It could work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no clue what it's going to involve. I got introduced to the other folks:
Don, Alan, Bryan, and Eric. Don and Alan have build a huge Python community
in Seattle. Eric organizes Write The Docs conference. &lt;em&gt;They know what
they're doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose a name: PyCascades. First one's in Vancouver.
Started looking for a venue. It's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizing PyCascades has been very challenging. Perhaps one day I'll write more
about the challenges. I'm just really proud that I get to be part of it. Lucky
that I get to be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycon-talk-acceptance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCon talk acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about the same time that we started organizing PyCascades, I was notified
that my talk was accepted at PyCon. I couldn't believe it! I read the email
again and again. It felt amazing! It was like a dream come true! I must have told
everyone I knew about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I got scared. &lt;strong&gt;I'm going to be give a non-technical talk at PyCon.&lt;/strong&gt;
Maybe nobody will show up for my talk. Maybe people showed up and then be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative thoughts creeping in. Booked a session with my therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="djangocon-europe-talk-acceptance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DjangoCon Europe talk acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still reveling and freaking out about PyCon, I found out that I've been
accepted to speak at DjangoCon Europe. Florence! I had never been to Europe!
Of course I accepted. My employer wasn't going to sponsor my trip. Submitted
my vacation request. Thanks to DjangoCon Europe's financial aid, I could actually
afford to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-python-core-developer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Python Core Developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I was going to get busy for the first half of the year. And it was only January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a life-changing event happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mentor, Raymond, messaged me. &amp;quot;I have good news for you&amp;quot;, he said.
&amp;quot;I nominated you for core-dev privileges.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you sure I'm ready for this?&amp;quot;, I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not to worry, I'll be responsible for your commits for a while. I'll continue
to mentor, help, and cheer you along the way. You'll be an important part of the
project.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core-dev privileges? What are they? What does it even mean, to be a Python Core
Developer? I guess, technically, somewhere, there's going to be a boolean flag
getting flipped. It's got to be more than that. The commit bit, comes with
special super power. With power, comes responsibility. Right? &lt;em&gt;Right?&lt;/em&gt; Except
I had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted with my other mentor, Guido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Raymond nominated me to be a core dev. What do you think? 'cause I'm not sure I'm
ready for this&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, you'll grow into the role.&amp;quot;, he dismissed my concerns.
&amp;quot;It will be good for Python to have you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure about this??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited. Happy. Scared. Anxious. All at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn't even know how to feel!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, there's a new entry in the Dev Guide of a new Python Core Developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life changed that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-talk-acceptance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More talk acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring time. Got my talk accepted at several other conferences.
I'd love to go to all of them, but my work wouldn't sponsor. It would mean that
I'll have to go on my own dime and take personal time off. I couldn't afford to go.
And I really should go on vacations with my husband and kids instead of traveling by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said no to most of them. I thought I'd be done speaking for the rest of the year
after PyCon US. But then I then I decided to speaking at PyCon Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I went to Australia for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="broken"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between PyCon US and PyCon Australia, I started applying for a new job again.
One rejection email after another. I ignored those emails. I needed to focus
on giving a new talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gave my talk, a talk about f-strings. I felt good about it. Now that it's done, I
finally have time to ponder about those rejection emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat all alone in my hotel room in Melbourne. I thought about what I wanted to
do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still wanted to get a new job. I suppose I should learn from my failures and
try to do better at the next interviews. So I read those emails again. I had asked
the recruiters if they have specific feedback of what I could improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;after reviewing your code, we don’t think you’re exactly the right fit for our role&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could they even determine this simply by looking at my code?
I guess this is just a generic message they send to everyone who failed. They
wouldn't even bother with giving me an honest feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reject email, dated July 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
... we don't think it makes sense to move forward
right now- primarily because we want to see continued growth in your technical skills.
However, we are really impressed with you overall and think you'd be a great culture
fit for &amp;lt;company&amp;gt;. Please keep us in mind and reach out if you'd like to enter the
process again in 1-2 years - we'd love to talk with you then.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What. Is. This.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;we want to see continued growth in your technical skills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the f--- have I been doing in the last 15 years, if not that? What else do
I need to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lost. I didn't know what else I could do to be better at the next interview.
I keep trying to find a lesson to be learned out of this. And I could not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's not technical skill that I lacked. I don't know what they want.
After all these years, I'm still not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke down. Buried my face in the pillow. Cried myself to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next morning came. Took a shower. Negative thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looked at the time. It's time to get going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiped my tears and washed my face one more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still unable to find any positivity. No light. Only darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to the sprint venue. Wrote some code. Replied to emails.
Tried to forget everything. I uploaded &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Mariatta/tic_tac_taco_pizza"&gt;tic tac taco pizza&lt;/a&gt; to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the most useless thing to be in PyPI&lt;/em&gt;. Didn't matter. For once, I
wrote code for myself. My kids would love it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie came over and showed me that she installed tic tac taco pizza and had
played it. Thank you Katie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then went on a road trip with Trey. The Great Ocean Road trip. It was great.
I saw the ocean. I love the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of my sadness, taken by the sea ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-core-sprint"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python Core Sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September. 20 core devs got together for a week. Facebook and The PSF sponsored my trip.
I had a great time. Really enjoyed meeting other core devs and spent time with them.
Because I had spent all of my vacation days, I was only able to be at the sprint
for 3 days instead of the full week. Lame. Wished I could have stayed longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the core devs worked on CPython. New PEPs being discussed. Ezio worked
on the Dev Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington"&gt;miss-islington&lt;/a&gt;, a
GitHub bot to backport changes from master to the other
maintenance branches. We needed this bot since we moved to GitHub months ago.
So far it has backported more than 300 pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="picking-up-the-pieces"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Picking up the pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that I was done for the year. Time to take a break.
Time to catch up on things I'd put off earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike wanted me to write for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2017/09/25/pydev-of-the-week-mariatta-wijaya/"&gt;PyDev of the Week&lt;/a&gt;
since a couple months ago. Finally got around doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became a guest at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://castalio.info/episodio-114-mariatta-wijaya-cpython.html"&gt;Castalio Podcast&lt;/a&gt;.
I had a lot of fun. I laughed a lot during the interview!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan asked me to write the foreword for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dbader.org/products/python-tricks-book/"&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt;.
Thanks Dan for this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyLadies Vancouver members wanted a workshop about Python Packaging. I thought
of Brett. Brett helped me publish &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; to PyPI for the first time ever.
Asked Brett if he could give a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/events/243207518/"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;.
He agreed. Thanks Brett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2017.pycon.ca/"&gt;PyCon Canada&lt;/a&gt; asked me to give a keynote. What an honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two different friends wanted to nominate me for some kind of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/women-in-open-source"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt;.
Wow! Thanks Gloria and Victor. Don't think I stack up against the other nominees
but it meant a lot that you both thought of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory nominated me for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/10/more-open-source-peer-bonus-winners.html"&gt;Google Open Source Peer Bonus&lt;/a&gt; award. That felt great.
Thanks Gregory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-family-doctor"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Family Doctor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family doctor no longer practicing. So I met with a new doctor. He reviewed
my medical history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I see here you have &lt;em&gt;mood swings&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he didn't want to say the dirty word in front of my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it should not be a dirty word. They probably won't understand it now.
In that split moment I decided that I wanted my kids to hear it.
That this is something we can talk about, openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have depression. And anxieties. Come and go in waves.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you take medication?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. Trying to manage it by seeing a therapist.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That's good. But come to me if you need medication.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I never need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="quitting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quitting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was ready to give up hope and to remain the my current job. A job that was no
longer satisfying. I tried leaving, but had no where else to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three different people had told me about this other company. &lt;em&gt;Great culture, great people. Give it a try!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really didn't think I could handle yet another rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got tired of trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the last time&lt;/em&gt;. That's what I said the time before. For real this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They seemed really nice and friendly. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Great people, great culture.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Will I
belong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They offered me the job. The next day I gave my notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anything we can do to keep you here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I could have asked for more money? For the promotion they denied me earlier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't make me beg for things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you. But I'm leaving.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart is someplace else now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reflecting-back"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflecting back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost a year since I became a Python Core Developer. Still not sure what
it really means to be a core dev. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What is it like?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Busy. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How can I become a core dev too?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;
I dunno. I got lucky. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How much time do you spend contributing?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Way too much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really made lots of contributions to open source and to Python this year.
Wrote a lot of documentation. Wrote some code. Made more than 600 pull requests.
Also reviewed a lot of them. Wrote &amp;quot;Thanks and congrats on your first
contribution to CPython&amp;quot; many many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shiny green &amp;quot;Squash and merge&amp;quot; button is no longer intimidating.
&amp;quot;You can always revert things.&amp;quot;, Brett said early on.
&amp;quot;Don't worry, you won't be breaking Python.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time I thought I had erased the entire history of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not. But I really thought I did. Longest 10 minutes of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned how to revert things on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of things happened this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some good. Some bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018? I only have one wish: that my tutorial gets accepted at PyCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, that sounds familiar ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
