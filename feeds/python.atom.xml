&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D52HmedWsAAr3D2.jpg:medium" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm one of 14 Zapiens at PyCon 2019. I staffed Zapier's booth on Friday and Saturday.
We had socks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-language-summit-2019"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python Language Summit 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language summit was a success. First of all, we were able to stay somewhat
on time, which I'm personally quite happy about. Other thing to be proud of,
it was the most diverse audience I've seen. Our audience consists of, not just long-time
Python core developers, but also new contributors as well as members from
the wider Python ecosystem, such as from Twisted, Django, and BeeWare project.
We had talks about circuit Python, team communication, and mentorship. I personally
think all the talks were very interesting and refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've invited A. Jesse Jiryu Davis to cover the event. You can see his posts
at The PSF's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-2019-python-language-summit.html"&gt;official blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We forgot to take a group photo after the summit!! 😱 but we had a group photo
with PyCon staff ... (image from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/pystar/status/1123782745585483776"&gt;PyCon's twitter account&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5hQscyW0AEIjUs.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pep-581"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PEP 581&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the topic of discussion was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt;.
Since Jesse is writing up the post about it, I won't duplicate the effort.
But you can see &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/mariatta/pep-581"&gt;my slides here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd really like to see us making progress with this before the next Python
Language Summit. There were lots of action items, and things we still need
to figure out, but those will be addressed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0588/"&gt;PEP 588&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to update PEP 588 with the items raised during the language summit,
I really haven't had much time to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hands-on-intro-to-aiohttp"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hands-on Intro to aiohttp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Svetlov and I gave a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us-pycon-2019-tutorial.readthedocs.io/"&gt;beginner tutorial to aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;.
Our tutorial material is available online, and licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew is the maintainer of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/"&gt;aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;, which
is licensed under Apache 2.0, He's very knowledgeable about it.
There were lots of interesting questions being asked at the tutorial, and he was
able to explain things clearly. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/matrixise"&gt;Stéphane Wirtel&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/webKnjaZ"&gt;Sviatoslav Sydorenko&lt;/a&gt; volunteered as our TA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D56v23uWAAIfE2Q.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="don-t-be-a-robot-build-the-bot"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't Be a Robot; Build the Bot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday after the keynote, I gave my talk titled &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xdEAxLuj9Y"&gt;Don't Be a Robot; Build the Bot&lt;/a&gt;.
I loved giving that talk! It's a talk about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/"&gt;miss-islington&lt;/a&gt;!
I think more people should be building their own bots and automate! With
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gidgethub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;gidgethub&lt;/a&gt; (Apache 2.0 licensed)
it is really easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="github-bots-are-one-honking-great-idea-let-s-do-more-of-those"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub bots are one honking great idea, let's do more of those!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sviatoslav and I hosted an open space on Sunday. We discussed more about GitHub bots,
building it for profit or for fun. Sviatoslav just made a new framework for building
GitHub Apps with Python 3.7, called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://octomachinery.dev/"&gt;octomachinery&lt;/a&gt;.
We also discussed about GitHub Actions, tried to make sense of it, e.g. what were
limitations, and what Actions would be useful. There is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/official-github-action-for-publishing-to-pypi/1061"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt;
for making an &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; GitHub Action for publishing to PyPI. Some people shared
ideas of what bots they'd like to see and build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One attendee (I think his name was Anurag Saxena(?)) said he'd like to
receive weekly updates of GitHub issues/PRs they
worked on, and to have it automatically sent to him as email or slack or
something. I think this is very interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product placement: this can be accomplished with Zapier. You can create a
cron job that generates the summary (by utilizing GitHub Search API), and then use
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://zapier.com/apps/webhook/integrations"&gt;Webhook by Zapier&lt;/a&gt; to handle the
&amp;quot;send email/post a slack message&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="status-of-black-out"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Status of black-out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned my personal bot, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mariatta/black_out"&gt;black-out&lt;/a&gt;, in
my talk. Black-out is a GitHub bot that runs black (Python formatter) on incoming pull
requests. The first version of the webhook-based bot is open source and Apache 2.0
licensed. However, I wasn't happy with how it works, so I've been researching on
how to turn it into a GitHub App.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made some progress with black-out GitHub App, I've implemented some of the features
I wanted for myself, but I'm still just experimenting and testing it out on my
own personal projects to really figure out what's the best workflow for the bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black-out GitHub App is still closed source, I have not put it up on GitHub yet.
After the talk, a few people, including &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/jezdez"&gt;Jannis Leidel&lt;/a&gt;
from Mozilla, expressed interest in black-out, and wanted to know how they can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the interest! I think I just need to find time and put it up on GitHub
so we can all collaborate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="aiohttp-bot"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;aiohttp bot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aiohttp needs a bot just like miss-islington, for backporting, and Andrew Svetlov
had talked to me about this since early last year. (and Ansible needs their own
backport bot too). To help with this, we've been working to make &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker/"&gt;cherry-picker.py&lt;/a&gt; customizable. I've offered to help
build this bot for aiohttp, and the easiest is a webhook-based bot, just like
miss-islington. However Sviatoslav disagrees. He prefers for it to be a GitHub
App that can be easily installed by other projects. While I like the GitHub App
idea, for reusability, I also think that each projects might have different workflow
for backporting, so we'll end up having to support &amp;quot;configuring the bot&amp;quot;, which is
a boring activity for me. I'll be thinking more about this, but my thinking right
now is to build it as a personal bot for aiohttp; not a customizable bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mentored-sprint-for-diverse-beginners"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mentored Sprint for Diverse Beginners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday afternoon (4 hrs) I helped ran the mentored sprint for Diverse Beginners. This
is a group effort with Tania Allard, Nina Zakharenko, and Nikoleta Glynatsi. We have
a room full of 70 new aspiring open source contributors, and about 30 mentors
from 11 different open source projects (like CPython, CircuitPython, TensorFlow,
etc) I think it was great success! The projects and mentors were tasked with
coming up with at least 5 beginner friendly issues, so they came prepared. Lots
of people with diverse background made their first pull requests at the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that surprised me, was such great turnout! I've organized lots of
events and meetups, and we usually expect about 60% people will actually show up.
But for this event, &lt;strong&gt;EVERYBODY&lt;/strong&gt; showed up! Room was completely full!! (103 pax capacity)
We even had to turn away many people who wanted to walk-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YRJD9tkQSHZBzFcB9" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keynotes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keynotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to see pretty much all of the keynotes, except for Jessica McKellar's keynote.
Her keynote started late, and I was supposed to staff Zapier's booth at the same
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sha's talk was very inspiring and emotional. I'm glad I was able to watch the
talk in person. I was going to suggest people to catch his talk, but unfortunately
there was no recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also enjoyed the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/8dDp-UHBJ_A"&gt;Steering council plenary session&lt;/a&gt;
moderated by Ewa Jodlowska. (there was mention about PEP 581!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycascades"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCascades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D50oSeaXkAEb-uv.jpg:large" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I met up with several PyCascades organizers and we discussed the planning of
next year's conference. We're still scouting venues in Portland, and figuring out
how to best divide tasks among the organizers. Eric Holscher will be co-chairing,
along with Esti. Somehow during that meeting, I became the next PyCascades
Diversity Chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pyladies"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyLadies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D56C8oTX4AESrtq.jpg:large" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(image from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/1125485680216485888"&gt;Lorena Mesa on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I attended a meeting with other PyLadies organizers from all over the world.
We shared notes about organizing and leading our own local chapters. We learned that
the challenges faced by PyLadies in different parts of the world are different. We
talked about how the current representation of PyLadies isn't very diverse (represented
by people in North America) whereas members of Python community and PyLadies are coming
from all over the world. We talked about ideas on how PyLadies can be better. We
discussed the governance of PyLadies, and decided to do a monthly PyLadies organizers
meeting. Elaine and I volunteered to take over managing info at pyladies email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dep-9"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DEP 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into Andrew Godwin who is a Django Core Developer. I got to ask him about
Django and asyncio. During the aiohttp tutorial, someone had asked about aiohttp
and ORM. Andrew Svetlov mentioned that it is a low priority for aiohttp, and so
I wondered what is Django's stance on this. Andrew (Godwin) shared his plan about
async-capable django. I guess he was talking about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin/status/1126328701593866240"&gt;DEP 9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="language-summit-retro-and-the-inspiration-for-black"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Language Summit retro, and the inspiration for black&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met with Łukasz Langa to celebrate success of running our first language summit.
We had informal retros, and started thinking about how to put the next year's event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to ask him where the inspiration for black came from. He described
frustration with other auto-formatter, how it does not provide consistent
output (same file reformatted twice would give different result). After months
of frustration, he decided to make his own auto-formatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D55tCx_W0AAT3tF.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="f-string-debug-mode"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;F-string Debug Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I had to give away all of my new f-string stickers to Eric V. Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric showed me a demo of debug mode for f-string. It adds the &lt;cite&gt;=&lt;/cite&gt; to the f-string
expression. I recalled we had this discussion with both Eric and Larry Hastings back during core Python sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
foo=5 print(f&amp;quot;{foo=}&amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would print:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
foo=5
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then the PR has been merged, and now we need to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue36858"&gt;write the documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D551XvfW4AImG49.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="people"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got to meet in person with people I've interacted online a lot, like:
Tania Allard, Cheryl Sabella, Anthony Shaw, Sviatoslav Sydorenko, Elizaaveta Shashkova,
and many more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D56eogZW0AAUZat.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coc-incidents"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CoC Incidents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the conference, it was brought to my attention about several CoC incidents
that occurred in various communities I belong to. These issues are being dealt
with, and I've also talked to PyCon incident response team members where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ice-cream-selfie"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ice Cream Selfie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had ice cream sandwich from Cathy's Gourmet Ice Cream Sandwiches, courtesy of Tania and Nina 🍨😝🤳🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D568l3_WsAE3pF7.jpg:large" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="pynutella"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyNutella&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyNutella, a.k.a that thing where Mariatta asks her friends who are coming to
PyCon to bring her Nutella from Europe, yeah that happened. Thanks to Christian
Heimes for the very special Nutella. My kids were mind blown to see them. Also
thanks to Stéphane Wirtel for a really big jar of Nutella from Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5l36DKW4AAsgKP.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="pierogicon"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PierogiCon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Ossowski, Jeff Triplett and I went back to Sokolowski's University Inn for the
second PierogiCon, and we brought in a number of newbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d67f75c6b92d5fe66cb81e3dc124e539/5D660D3C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/59183211_108900943546171_9078212037958768043_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="selfie-sprint"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Selfie Sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was meaning to do one day of sprints, but after a full week full of activities,
I decided not to do any open source activities, and instead just go around
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;vertical=default&amp;amp;q=mariatta%20%23selfiesprint&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;take selfie with people I met&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed doing Selfie Sprint! I think I will do it again next year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D56wr4nW4AcVeL6.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="seafood"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seafood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to see my brother for dinner. We had really great spicy seafood at Boiling Seafood Crawfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/21ef88439f3331f9aa4990f886749903/5D6E3634/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s750x750/57488426_1264143830402264_5360864775533430374_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="award"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Award&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest highlight for me is receiving my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-north-star-of-pycascades-core.html"&gt;Community Service Award&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.
Thank you Python community for this recognition! (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4IfFLAX9hY"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Until next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to include as many memories as I can into this post, but I'm unable to include
everything. 😥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon 2019 has been inspiring. I learned a lot about the community, and I cried
a lot too (the good cry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and all the wonderful Python community for these memories.
Let's do this again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🌮&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Cleveland last night for PyCon 2019! It'll be quite busy and jam-packed
event for me!! Looking forward to meet old friends and make new ones!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are my pre-planned PyCon activities. But I'm sure in actuality
I'll be even more busier for the unplanned ones! 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/"&gt;Python Language Summit&lt;/a&gt;,
co-chairing with Łukasz. I'm also going to present the topic about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0588/"&gt;PEP 588&lt;/a&gt;. Followed by PyCon staff dinner. 😋&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;: Andrew Svetlov and I will be giving our tutorial together: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/68/"&gt;Hands-on
Intro to aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;. I'll
also be checking the expo hall for the opening reception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;: I plan to attend the keynote, and then my own talk: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/218/"&gt;Don't Be a
Robot; Build the Bot&lt;/a&gt;
(Friday 10:50 a.m.–11:20 a.m. in Grand Ballroom B). I'll also be at Zapier's
booth (#713) from 3:45 - 4:30 PM. Come find me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt;: Attend the morning keynotes, and again at Zapier's booth (#713)
from 10:10 – 10:50 AM. PSF Member's lunch, and then the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mentored-sprint-for-diverse-beginners.readthedocs.io/"&gt;Mentored Sprint for
Diverse Beginners&lt;/a&gt;,
co-organized with Tania, Nina, and Nikoleta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;: Attend all the keynotes. Sviatoslav Sydorenko and I plan to do
an open space at 11 AM, with topic: &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Bots are one honking great idea --
let's do more of those! Let's talk about building GitHub Apps as a community&lt;/strong&gt;.
PyLadies lunch. Receive my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-north-star-of-pycascades-core.html"&gt;PSF Community Service&lt;/a&gt;
award. Dinner with my brother. This might be the last time in many years
before I'll get to see him again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;: Sprint! Probably try to catch up with all the things I've been missing
out since I went OOOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Go home!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ice-cream-selfie"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ice Cream Selfie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So unlike me, I have not decided where to go for &lt;a class="reference external" href="../pages/ice-cream-selfie.html"&gt;Ice Cream Selfie&lt;/a&gt;!!
😱 Last year I went to &lt;a class="reference external" href="../ics-pyconus-2018.html"&gt;Mitchell's Homemade Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are additional discussions and projects that I got involved with during the
sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pep-581"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PEP 581&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt; is a PEP I wrote about using
GitHub issues instead of Roundup as CPython's issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sprint, I discussed this topic mainly with Ezio …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Read up on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mariatta.ca/core-sprint-2018-part-1.html"&gt;Part one&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are additional discussions and projects that I got involved with during the
sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pep-581"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PEP 581&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt; is a PEP I wrote about using
GitHub issues instead of Roundup as CPython's issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sprint, I discussed this topic mainly with Ezio Melotti, as well as
with a group of other core devs: Ned Deily, Kushal Das, Petr Viktorin, Pablo Galindo,
and one-on-one with Zachary Ware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks all of you who came and discussed this with me, I really appreciate your
input and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting back, my tone might have been unkind, impatient, and unempathetic during
certain parts of the group discussion, and I'm sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most other PEPs, the idea for this PEP did not go through rounds of
discussions over at python-ideas. And unlike other PEPs, I did not post this PEP
into python-dev after it has been written. It was my own choice. Instead, this idea
was discussed at Python Language Summit, as a thread at python-committers, and
I also chatted privately with a few other Python core developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezio, who maintains Roundup for CPython, talked to various core devs individually
to get a sense whether people are warm to the idea of moving to GitHub. It seems
like people are postive about it, or at least not strongly opposing the idea,  but
we still need to iron out additional details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the concerns raised during the discussions with core devs at
the sprint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if GitHub disappear suddenly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that my response to this question had been unkind, impatient,
unempathetic, and I'm sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response was &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I don't care&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really meant is, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I don't believe GitHub will go away all that suddenly&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;,
and that is my personal opinion, and I know there are people who thinks otherwise,
and I respect the difference in opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the actual question needing actual answer is: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What is our fail safe plan?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.
This is something that the PEP needs to address. At the moment, we'll just going to get
daily backups of GitHub data. But eventually we will need a more concrete
plan and we will need to be able to easily spin up another issue tracker / repository
so Python world does not stop and people can continue
contributing and developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this problem is not unique to CPython. Lack of fail-safe solution should
not blocking the PEP's acceptance, and should not stop us from using GitHub issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about current bug triage permission?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Roundup currently, we have a separate &amp;quot;bug triage&amp;quot; permission that is different
than the core developer / commit access. The bug triage permission allows them
to close and categorize issues on the issue tracker, but does not give the
permission to commit or merge pull requests to CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug triage permission is definitely valuable for the team. Historically,
we've been able to give this permission easily to people without much formality,
whereas giving commit access is not so trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We definitely need bug triage help, and the question is, how will this be managed
with GitHub?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple ideas. Donald Stufft commented in Zulip that we can give
people write access, invite them as team collaborators, this will allow them to
edit and close issues, but use the GitHub branch protection feature to restrict
pushing codes to only Python core developers. BTW, we have been using this
feature, just didn't quite realize it. Python &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;3.4&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;3.5&lt;/tt&gt; branches on GitHub
are currently &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot;, and only the release manager, Larry Hastings, can
push codes to those branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we can do is to invite the current bug triagers as collaborators for
CPython repository, give them that write access, and add branch protection
such that only Python core developers can push / commit into the active branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea that came up while chatting with Zach, now that miss-islington
can automerge, maybe we let only miss-islington to merge and commit from now on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nosy list&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Dower commented that one nice feature of the existing issue tracker is
the nosy list, where he can get notified only in issues he's interested in. For
example, if someone creates an issue with &amp;quot;Windows&amp;quot; component in the current issue
tracker, he and Zach will be automatically notified and added to the nosy list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not yet similar functionality on GitHub. So we're going to build out a
bot that does this somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started researching GitHub's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/notifications/"&gt;notification and subscription APIs&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't have
clear idea or solution to this problem yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involve the Python Release manager in the transition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ned Deily, Release Manager for Python 3.6 and 3.7, reminded us that we will need
to include the release managers for any changes in our workflow and issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub can lower the barrier to contribute, but also makes it easier for people to submit unrelevant issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some core devs were concerned that the ease of using GitHub can also mean easier
for people to use and abuse it for things other than discussing bugs and features of
Python. It means that we will need to spend more time into triaging issues, marking
things as off topic, duplicate, telling people to file their issue somewhere else,
and so on. I think this is a valid concern. But I think this is an existing problem
anyway, regardless of what issue tracker we use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gitmate.io/"&gt;GitMate.io&lt;/a&gt; myself.
One of Gitmate's ability is to identify if an issue is a duplicate of other previously
reported issues. GitMate is currently installed in devguide, core-workflow, and
miss-islington repos. I've seen it help several people, but sometimes it is not
so helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CoC enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to have better and clearer policy on CoC enforcement for handling comments
on GitHub. I know that there is the PSF's CoC work group now, and Brett is part of that
group. I'm glad that there is some progress, and I look forward hearing more from the
CoC work group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cla"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CLA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of CPython's workflow that could use an improvement is the way we
handle CLA (Contributor License Agreement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it works, for every contribution and pull request you made to Python
(CPython, DevGuide, PEPs, core-workflow, and all the bots), you'll need to
sign the CLA before we can accept and merge the pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently several problems with this workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signing the CLA also requires creating an account in the bug tracker. So
people making pull requests on GitHub needs to go to bugs.python.org, create
an account, and then add in their GitHub username. While this makes sense
for contributors to CPython, there is really no reason for contributors to
DevGuide or cherry-picker to do this. It just slows down the process of
contributing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires manual work by members of The PSF (Ewa and Betsy) to check if the CLA
has been signed, and they have to manually update the record in bugs.python.org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the CLA has been signed, the pull request does not get automatically
updated with this new information. Contributors used to have to ping a core
developer to update the label on the PR, and a core developer has to come back
to the PR and remove the label. This has gotten better recently, with the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://check-python-cla.herokuapp.com/"&gt;check-python-cla&lt;/a&gt; website. But it
still is somewhat manual process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could take at least a day, sometimes more, for the CLA process to clear. It
blocks pull requests from being merged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really would be nice if this whole process can be automated, not requires much
human involvement, and if it can be completed in seconds instead of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been discussing this issue with Brett since early this year. I've also
started a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/mm3/archives/list/core-workflow&amp;#64;python.org/thread/JBV3XJVD2DLDX5DY7TZEA6CO5YPNHJ2C/"&gt;couple threads&lt;/a&gt;
in core-workflow mailing list. Per Yury's suggestion, I've started looking into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cla-assistant.io/"&gt;cla-assistant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sprint, I got to discuss this more with Brett on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal preference is actually use the hosted version of cla-assistant,
so we don't have to maintain it. (&lt;strong&gt;We&lt;/strong&gt; here really means only myself, Brett,
and Ernest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People expressed concern that the system could go away quite suddenly, so
we're going to need to have some fail-safe mechanism if that ever happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the problem of &amp;quot;what if this goes away suddenly&amp;quot; is not be unique problem
to Python. I'm now actually curious to hear from other projects that use hosted
cla-assistant, and if they have their own backup plan in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted with Ernest, and he said it will be easy enough for us to host our
own instance of CLA assistant. Ernest has started looking into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several outstanding issues with cla-assistant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it handle people who signed on behalf of an organization?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows us to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant#request-more-information-from-the-cla-signer"&gt;request more information from the CLA signer&lt;/a&gt;,
but when we export the data, the additional metada were not returned. It seems
like a bug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we get daily backups automatically? It seems like the only way to get the
backup is by going to the website, and click on a menu item that says &amp;quot;Export&amp;quot;.
Is there an API endpoint we can use, or do we need to build it ourselves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we export out current signed CLAs from the bug tracker to cla-assistant?
Ezio had actually started working on getting me a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.csv&lt;/tt&gt; for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran out of time and energy to follow through with all of the above during the
sprint, so sadly we're still not yet using this new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Brett, Ernest, and Ezio for looking into this with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fake-f-strings"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fake f-strings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I selfishly wanted Larry to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/283"&gt;drop Python 3.5 support&lt;/a&gt; in blurb. Blurb was
initially written with f-strings, but later on, all f-strings were replaced with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/pull/146"&gt;str.format&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been quite disappointed about it since last year, and I know I actually
have better things to do than being sad about a tool so crucial for CPython does
not have any f-strings in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Larry entertained my selfish request and came up with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/pull/288"&gt;fake f-strings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take it. Thanks Larry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="real-f-strings-and-asyncio"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real f-strings and asyncio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until the sprint, I had never tried doing something like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;f&amp;quot;{await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;somecoroutine()}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;,
so I didn't know if it would even work. Since the creators and maintainers of
f-strings and asyncio are in the room, I thought I'll just ask them if it can work,
and I should get a quick firm &amp;quot;yes/no&amp;quot; answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was slight hesitation from core devs in answering such question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It should work?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I think so?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Brett wrote us a small script to see if it will really work, with myself and
Eric V. Smith as witness. The result is, this works for Python 3.7+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out later that it does not work in Python 3.6, but I don't actually know
the reason why. Something changed with how &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;await&lt;/tt&gt; works between 3.6 and 3.7?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤷🏻‍♀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Yury &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/1st1/status/1042858310641152001"&gt;commented on twitter&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;yes, this needs Python 3.7+ to work. Before 3.7 async and await were not proper
keywords, so the interpreter did not recognize them in some contexts.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Yury! Now we have new reason to start using Python 3.7+!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="to-be-continued"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To be continued&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be Part 3, &lt;em&gt;someday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I was only able to stay for the sprint for three days. This year
I'm able to stay for the entire week. I got a lot more things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Steve Dower, for organizing this sprint and figuring out all the
logistics for us. Coordinating this is no easy task, and everything runs smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big thanks to Microsoft for hosting us in Reactor Redmond B20. The facility and the
campus was really awesome. (Ice cream at the back of the room!) I got to
try out the Hololens! Thanks for treating us for a nice dinner, with guest speaker
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg"&gt;Anders Hejlsberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to The PSF for providing the fund, getting many core devs from all over the
world. It's been valuable being able to spend the whole week collaborating and
talk face-to-face. We really don't get too many opportunities to do this. Sprints
at conferences are normally our opportunity to help onboard new contributors
to Python. Core sprint like this serves a different purpose where we get to focus
on some of our bigger projects, brainstorm with each other, and make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Zapier, especially my manager, and my teammates at the Partner Engagement
Team, for being supportive and giving me the time away from work. Zapier has
flexible time off policy, so I'm not limited to only taking X days off from work
each year. In addition, I get to focus on Python for the whole week, and not
needed to keep doing daily standup or weekly team meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my family, for supporting and being able to manage themselves while
I'm away. I have been traveling away without them, for work and for Python, once
a month each month since January of this year, and even more of such trips that's
been arranged all the way until August 2019. It really has not been easy for
all of us. But it motivated me to make the most of my time at the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the core developers who came, away from their home, from their family and work,
for Python. We had many great discussions and chats during the past week, they've
all been very productive, and I really enjoyed being able to spend time with everyone
for Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="new-python-core-developers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Python Core Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome Emily Morehouse-Valcarcel and Lisa Roach as new Python core developers!
They're both brilliant, and have been &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-September/006059.html"&gt;contributing to Python&lt;/a&gt;
in the past couple years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="miss-islington"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miss-islington&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;miss-islington is a GitHub bot that first developed at last year's core sprint.
The original task of miss-islington was to automatically create backport PRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, she gained new privilege. She's been allowed to merge her own PR once
it has been approved by another core dev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, miss-islington gained a new superpower. She can now automatically
merge any pull requests that core dev wants her to merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As context, there had been long and lengthy discussion about this &amp;quot;automerge&amp;quot;
ability. Discussion started in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/29"&gt;core-workflow issue #29&lt;/a&gt;,
opened by Donald Stufft February 2017. It is one functionality that GitLab
has that improves productivity, that GitHub does not yet provide. And as indication
of how complicated CPython workflow is, further discussion about this spilled over to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/issues/14"&gt;bedevere issue #14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have come to the resolution and decision of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/issues/14#issuecomment-399585735"&gt;how the automerge&lt;/a&gt; should
work, I guess I just have not find any time to completely focus and work
on implementing it. I spent almost the whole day of the first day of sprint
to implement this. I don't normally have that &amp;quot;one full day to focus and undisturbed to work on Python&amp;quot;
thing, so needless to say, I might never get this done without coming to the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're curious of how this was implemented, miss-islington is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;.
In addition, I will give a keynote speech at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2018.djangocon.us/news/mariatta-wijaya/"&gt;DjangoCon US 2018&lt;/a&gt;,
titled &lt;strong&gt;Don't Be a Robot; Build the Bot&lt;/strong&gt;
where I plan to describe some of miss-islington's architecture and challenges in
building it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the pull requests related to automerge feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/146"&gt;Automerge PR labeled with &amp;quot;automerge&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/151"&gt;Normalize commit messages on automerge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/152"&gt;Don't automerge if there is &amp;quot;DO-NOT-MERGE&amp;quot; label and &amp;quot;CLA not signed&amp;quot; label&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open issues that we will need to address, eventually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/issues/153"&gt;Rate limited since the automerge has been deployed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/issues/155"&gt;Keep track of who triggered the automerge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/issues/154"&gt;Miss-islington should not self-assign PR that failed to backport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/issues/159"&gt;automerge shouldn't let GH wrap the first line of the commit message&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also read my announcement to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-September/006043.html"&gt;python-committers&lt;/a&gt; about the automerge,
as well as watch a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/p85YtKKLNno"&gt;YouTube demo video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="blurb-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blurb it!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of our requirement for every pull requests that you send to CPython, is a news
entry describing the change. This had been heavily discussed and designed in
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/6"&gt;core-workflow issue #6&lt;/a&gt;,
and we now have Larry Hasting's tool, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/blurb/"&gt;blurb&lt;/a&gt;
(available on PyPI), to help with this. In addition, we have a status check in place
by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere"&gt;bedevere&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that the news
file exists, and that we don't forget to add it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry's blurb works really great, and everyone has been using it without issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal nitpick about this, is that (and it's because I'm very lazy), blurb
is a command line tool, and so I have to be on my computer in order to use it.
A lot of time, I found myself reviewing a pull request while on my phone,
and all it needed was a news entry. But since I was on my phone, on transit,
by the beach, or whatever, I could not complete this process, and had to
wait until I'm back on the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been thinking that it would be nice and convenient if there was a web
interface for blurb. A place for me to fill in a form, and the news file automatically
gets added to the pull request. I had asked Larry earlier at PyCon what he thinks
about this idea. He said that he's okay with it, and he had in fact &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-June/148448.html"&gt;mentioned it himself&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;... it should be easy for
some JavaScript expert to write a static page that generates blurb files
for you--it provides a form, you fill it out, and you &amp;quot;download&amp;quot; the
blurb file.  (I've seen pages that do that sort of thing, though I don't
know how to write that kind of JavaScript myself.)&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; (python-dev, June 24, 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don't actually know how to write that kind of JavaScript either, I wrote
it all in Python 3.7, using fine libraries like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aiohttp-session.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;aiohttp-session&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aiohttp-jinja2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;aiohttp-jinja2&lt;/a&gt;, asyncio, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gidgethub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;gidgethub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting to write this project, I needed to come up with a project name,
and of course it was the hardest part of the process. I had thought of unimaginative
names like, &amp;quot;Blurb on the web&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;blurb_ee (ee: extended edition, pronounced &lt;em&gt;blurbee&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;quot;.
Gregory P. Smith suggested &amp;quot;Blurb 2.0&amp;quot;. It sounds okay, except that I'm not actually implementing
a new &amp;quot;blurb&amp;quot;. I'm trying to provide an enhancement of &amp;quot;blurb add&amp;quot; command, so it
is only a subset of the full &amp;quot;blurb&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Blurb 2.0&amp;quot; sounds incorrect to me. Larry
himself suggested: &amp;quot;webLurb&amp;quot; (pronounced webblurb, or maybe we blurb?). In the end,
I went with, &amp;quot;blurb_it&amp;quot;, to which Guido responded: &amp;quot;ship_it&amp;quot;. 🚢&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I demoed the prototype of blurb_it at Microsoft meetup on Thursday. I've started
a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/blurb_it/pull/2"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;, and currently
it is available on my own free Heroku instance at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://my-blurb-it.herokuapp.com/"&gt;https://my-blurb-it.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still more work to be done for blurb_it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add travis CI integration to the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer app ownership to The PSF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it as a GitHub App instead of an OAuth App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add form validation that the news entry has to be more than 30 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for Andrew's feedback on best practises when using aiohttp-session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="to-be-continued"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To be continued&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all the time I have to write up about the sprint. I'm heading back to
Vancouver, and will be out-of-open source for the rest of the month. But I plan
to continue with more details of some of the other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mariatta.ca/core-sprint-2018-part-2.html"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Zapier for fully supporting my trip to PyCon, and for allowing me to
take the time away from work for more than a week. The significance of this, for
me personally, is that for the first time I didn't need to apply for financial
aid in order to attend PyCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Zapier's support, I was able to stay for two days of sprints. It means
I get to contribute for open source for &lt;strong&gt;two full days&lt;/strong&gt;! 😆🌮&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-language-summit"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python Language Summit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the Python Language Summit for the second year. This time I presented
two topics. I had planned to do a lightning talk too, but by end of the day
I was too exhausted, so no lightning talk from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language summit was open to Python core developers, and by invitation only.
There was no recording, however there will be an article by Jake Edge from LWN.
I presented two talk topics at the language summit. I'll leave you in suspense
as you await the LWN article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little side anecdote, when I first became a Python Core Developer last year,
a couple core devs and a BDFL each told me about the language summit. And each
one of them &lt;strong&gt;warned&lt;/strong&gt; me of a certain &lt;em&gt;incident&lt;/em&gt; happened at the language summit in
the past. To protect the identity and the integrity of the folks involved, I won't
say what the incident was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, I kept hearing of the same incident mentioned by several
other core devs. So I came to think of it as an urban legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might have been two new urban legends born at Python Language
Summit 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tutorial"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tutorial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/ZwvjtCjimiw"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; at PyCon. I think it went quite well.
I definitely can be a better instructor next time, but I believe the attendees had
fun and learned many new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to thank my friends for coming and helping out at my tutorial. Many attendees
faced technical difficulties, and I would not have been able to attend to them
one by one. Really, it would not have gone as well without their help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So thank you friends: Jane Williams, Matt Davis, Ned Deily, Victor Stinner,
Stéphane Wirtel, Eric V. Smith, Christian Heimes. You're all the best!
Thanks Carol Willing and Guido van Rossum for dropping by, and special thanks
Brett Cannon for the cameo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="talks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/hhj7eb6TrtI"&gt;What is a Python Core Developer&lt;/a&gt;.
Poured my heart out, and felt really good afterwards. Thank you
everyone who came to my talk, (and for the standing ovation 🙇🏻‍♀️).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only managed to go to a several keynotes and talks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITksU31c1WY"&gt;Dan Callahan's Keynote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprint"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt quite productive during the sprint days!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of two days I made these contributions to open source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Released &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker/"&gt;cherry_picker v1.1.1&lt;/a&gt; to PyPI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussed the documentation for PEP 557 with Eric V. Smith and Ned Deily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slacked off too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still found time to chat and gossip with other folks during the sprint days.
Thanks Ned Batchelder, Anna Ossowski, Jeff Triplett, Ernest W. Durbin III, and Guido
van Rossum for being available and lending their ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="regret"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regret&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had wanted to help writing the documentation for PEP 557, the dataclasses module.
In the end I was not able to help with anything. Thank you Eric V. Smith for
writing up the proper documentation. Check it out &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/dataclasses.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric also gave me a crash course of the dataclasses module. No better way to
learn about it from the creator himself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rainbow-roses"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rainbow Roses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered a dozen rainbow roses to be delivered to my hotel room. They're very
lovely. I think I will make this a new ritual. 🌹💐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the roses didn't make it, that's why there are only eleven in the photo. 😛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/pycon2018-rainbowroses.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="poison"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Poison&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, I had 11 shots of tequila over the period of 7 days. Eric Holscher
started to make a comment about it and James Bond and martini... 🤐
&lt;em&gt;I'm much less exciting than James Bond!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At dinner one evening with Victor and Guido, I didn't see tequila on the menu.
So we ended up with this cute drink that has only 12% alcohol. 😭&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/pycon2018-cutedrink.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wat"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wat?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Beazley included &lt;cite&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;F&amp;quot;Yes!&amp;quot;&lt;/cite&gt; in his &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/995343478015102976"&gt;talk slides&lt;/a&gt;.
I didn't realize that he'd been reading my tweets. 🤭&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of people who proudly wore their PyCascades t-shirt at PyCon truly amazed me.
Thank you!!!
🙇🏻‍♀️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the folks who said hi and told me that they know me by reputation...
🙇🏻‍♀🙇🏻‍♀🙇🏻‍♀🙇🏻‍♀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="photos"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other favorite memories from PyCon 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Until next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to include as many memories as I can into this post, but I'm unable to include
everything. 😥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to chat and met with many many more people: all the Python Core Developers,
Python BDFL, open source project maintainers, PyLadies members, speakers, and various members
of this community. It's been inspiring and I learned a lot from all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon 2018 had been very very busy, intense, special, and lovely. Thank
you organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and all the wonderful Python community for these memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🌮&lt;/p&gt;
