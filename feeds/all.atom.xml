&lt;p&gt;Well there was Canada Day stat holiday last weekend. My kids are out of school

&lt;li&gt;Learning about GraphQL, wrote a few lines of JS codes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researching other ways to run django management commands from admin. Came across the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/django-admincommand/"&gt;django-admincommand&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other django-related work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some code reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployed to prod a few times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career growth discussion with my manager.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Python and the community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2019/06/webinar-recording-build-a-github-bot-with-mariatta-wijaya/"&gt;webinar with PyCharm&lt;/a&gt;!
I got to talk a bit about contributing to Python, and I also get to show how
you can automate your GitHub work with Zapier. Check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a couple new &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mariatta.ca/pages/about.html"&gt;GitHub sponsors&lt;/a&gt;
in the 🍪 tier. ❤️ Thank you! That brings it to 22 sponsors! You too can &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/users/Mariatta/sponsorship"&gt;sponsor
me on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for as little as $5/month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helped with the setup of PyLadies Monrovia (Liberia).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created more PyLadies Slack-bots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sent an update about PEP 581 to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev&amp;#64;python.org/thread/WXXY5RY5UV6DGBKANMHCGOW4UIKXVZ6S/"&gt;python-dev&lt;/a&gt;,
outlining the risks and downsides of GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued working on aiohttp-bot. I created &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp-bot/pull/2"&gt;a PR&lt;/a&gt;,
but I still need to write more unit tests. Also, I found a bug with black-out. 😟&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some back and forth email communications with GitHub Support team and Ewa Jodlowska,
to get the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/proposal-create-bug-triage-team-on-github/992"&gt;Triagers role enabled for CPython&lt;/a&gt;.
The Python org on GitHub is now a non-profit organization, and we're in the Teams plan.
Thanks to Ewa and GitHub for all the help! For the next steps, you can check out
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/projects/3"&gt;project in core-workflow GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;We handed over the keys to our old home to the new owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Took the kids to the circus 🎪 I think the performers are pretty talented!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Tried cooking gamjatang. It's ok but still not as good as I expected. Gotta try again
next time with different recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Our kids just started learning to bike on two wheels! They're making great
progress and we've been practising in the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Started scheming our next annual family vacation. We've been going to Cancún for
the last 3 family vacations. This time we'll be doing something else, but still in the
Caribbean. It's going to be FUN!! 😁&lt;/p&gt;

mariatta at pyladies dot com 📧 (Thanks Lynn and Ernest for the help in

Of course, when I said I'll do things, I really mean I'm creating bots to do
all of these. PyLadies have lots of bots now! 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Perhaps quite a milestone: GvR and I officially ended our 1:1 mentorship sessions,
almost exactly 3 years since I first reached out to him . It is a strange thing
to admit, but I finally feel like I'm really &lt;em&gt;ready&lt;/em&gt;.
I feel well-equipped and well-supported by other members in the
community. I'm quite happy to be able to give his time back.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Another week of tending to &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:info&amp;#64;pyladies.com"&gt;info&amp;#64;pyladies.com&lt;/a&gt; mailbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/events/261900321/"&gt;PyLadies Vancouver meetup&lt;/a&gt; happened!
I think it was well attended, and all the talks were great. A couple people expressed
interest in giving talks next time. There was also interest in doing a meetup
to brainstorm talk ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two new &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mariatta.ca/pages/about.html"&gt;GitHub sponsors&lt;/a&gt; this week,
both in the 🍩 tier. ❤️ Thank you! That brings it to 19 sponsors! 😲&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalized arrangements for doing a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2019/06/build-a-github-bot-with-mariatta-wijaya/"&gt;webinar with PyCharm&lt;/a&gt;.
There will be time for Q &amp;amp; A!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 3.8.0b1 was released earlier this week. It means Python 3.8 is no longer
accepting new features, and available for bug fix only. It means, the CPython
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;master&lt;/tt&gt; is now open for development of Python 3.9, and a new maintenance
branch &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;3.8&lt;/tt&gt; was created. Seems straightforward so far. One of a boring
routine task related to this is that we now need the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;needs backport to 3.8&lt;/tt&gt;
label on GitHub. It might not be obvious, but any Python core developers and
Python release managers can easily create the label.
However, Łukasz had taken the trouble &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/331"&gt;to create an issue&lt;/a&gt;
requesting that the label be created. Creating a label is boring, and really
shouldn't require two core devs to be involved. Writing a bot that does this is
more fun. So I &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/pull/174"&gt;wrote the bot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/membership/#what-membership-classes-are-there"&gt;PSF Supporting Member&lt;/a&gt;,
so I got to cast my vote in The PSF's Board of Directors election.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I proposed that we &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/enable-github-sponsors-on-python-org/1816"&gt;enable the Sponsors feature for CPython&lt;/a&gt;.
Seems like this will be discussed by The Steering Council.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enabled sponsorship for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies"&gt;PyLadies on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="etc"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;etc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Our old home is finally &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://vanrealty.ca/officelistings.html/listing.r2376795-7387-magnolia-terrace-burnaby-v5e-4m3.88510113"&gt;listed for sale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;It was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival"&gt;Dragon Boat Festival&lt;/a&gt;
on Friday. One of the traditions related to this festival, other than actual
dragon boat racing, is making and eating rice dumplings. Last time we did this
was two years ago. It is a time-consuming activity, but I kinda enjoy it.
I spent Friday evening and a few more hours on Saturday. We made 70 dumplings!
These absolutely taste better than storebought ones.&lt;/p&gt;

Lots of things happened, and I've kept busy 😥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a week in Berlin for GitHub Satellite. I might write a post just about
that later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked remotely from Germany for a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished several new stories and deployed to production. Created a new API
endpoint, built with Django Rest Framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-and-the-community"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python and the community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Chatted with Devon Zuegel and GitHub about GitHub Sponsors program. Spent time
creating my sponsorship tiers. I'm one of the first few maintainers with access
to this program. You can &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/users/Mariatta/sponsorship"&gt;sponsor me on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
for 5$/month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Listed all my current sponsors &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mariatta.ca/pages/about.html"&gt;on my personal website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;I appeared in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.blog/2019-05-31-maintainer-spotlight-mariatta-wijaya/"&gt;GitHub Maintainer Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Blog post about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/05/mariatta-wijaya-lets-use-github-issues.html"&gt;PEP 581 at Python Language Summit&lt;/a&gt;
is now up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;While in Berlin, I got to meet other Germany-based Python core developers: Christian
Heimes, Stefan Behnel, and Matthias Klose. I also got to hang out with Raphael
Pierzina, Jannis Leidel, other Python package maintainers, and with the scientists behind
the historic black hole image! 🤩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Chatted with Anwesha Das about PyLadies, and about CLA. Anwesha has a very
interesting idea related to CLA. I won't say much about this for now until
she has more time to research the topic and present it to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Started working on aiohttp-bot for autobackporting aiohttp pull requests. Chatted
more with Andrew to find out his requirements for this bot. I'll probably
have this bot ready by end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Made several small-ish pull requests to aio-libs: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis/pull/600"&gt;aio-redis PR #600&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/.github/pull/3"&gt;.github PR #3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp-session/pull/371"&gt;aiohttp-session PR #371&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp-session/pull/370"&gt;aiohttp-session PR #370&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Some fixes to miss-islington: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/237"&gt;PR #237&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/234"&gt;PR #234&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Released &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker/1.3.2/"&gt;cherry_picker v1.3.2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Added dependabot to my personal projects, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/326"&gt;to several projects under Python org&lt;/a&gt;.
Requested the automerge to be enabled for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Started &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/329"&gt;moving cherry-picker out of core-workflow repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/325"&gt;Chatted with Matthias Bussonnier&lt;/a&gt;
about security issue with &amp;quot;🤖 automerge&amp;quot;. I need to think more on how to solve this issue. 😟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Finally got around sending out feedback forms for mentored sprint for
diverse beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Chatted with Ernest about several infrastructure-related issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/using-cla-assistant-for-python/990"&gt;CLA Assistant for Python&lt;/a&gt;,
this is pending further discussion with Van Lindberg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/20"&gt;GitHub backup data&lt;/a&gt;.
We already have daily backup in place, it needs
to be documented in devguide. Ernest said he will prepare the PR
for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/add-sentry-integration-to-all-the-bots/1637/2"&gt;Adding Sentry for CPython bots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;It is my turn to look after &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:info&amp;#64;pyladies.com"&gt;info&amp;#64;pyladies.com&lt;/a&gt; mailbox. Answered several emails,
and forwarded emails to local chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;I joined The PSF Board member's slack to get an idea what's involved as a
board member for The PSF. After thinking more about it, I decided not to run
for it this time. I wanted to focus on my other projects and priorities for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Made a last-minute &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/events/261900321/"&gt;PyLadies Vancouver meetup&lt;/a&gt;
planning. I learned that Raphael will be in town, and I think it would be a
great opportunity for PyLadies Vancouver community to meet and learn about
pytest and cookiecutter from one of the maintainers. I'm happy that Raphael
has kindly agreed to give a talk, but from organizers point of view, it would
be better if we can find more speakers from our own community. It seemed
impossible at first, but in short period of time, we're able to find
3 additional speakers 🎉 It'll be a great Talk Night this coming Wednesday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="etc"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;etc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;I tried currywurst in Berlin. The first one was from a food court nearby
my hotel, and it was ... very interesting. Then Matthias took us to another
currywurst place, Curry 36, and it was pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Went sightseeing in Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/94cd1bf03e8e3fcdb3f3e2a796296576/5D8D9D11/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/60774705_842977589421413_4344408118954462167_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Right after I returned from Germany, it was my husband's turn for work travel. So
last week I was a busy single mom. It was one reason I didn't find time
to write up my update (and jet-lagged 😵)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Returned several times to our old home for more repairs and cleaning.
Painters came, and the place is looking nice and fresh. I highly
recommend hiring Liz from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://paintoasis.ca/"&gt;Interior Paint Oasis&lt;/a&gt;
for your next paint job in Greater Vancouver area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Talked to our realtor and preparing the house to be listed. Photographers
will come tomorrow for pictures, and the listing should be up soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;It was my oldest son's birthday in the weekend. When we asked what he wants.
he said &amp;quot;steak!&amp;quot; 😅 So we got some steak from our favorite butcher, Kea's Meats and
Deli in Burnaby, and fired our BBQ. 🥩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4eb7cecd42ba68bc431d5450f994c9d1/5D963FAD/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s750x750/61717698_201827660796960_1872409219047849938_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last week I was playing catch up after missing work for a whole week. I also
started re-working a PR I made. I was working on creating a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;v3&lt;/tt&gt; API endpoint,
but we needed it as &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;v4&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week we had our first &amp;quot;remote&amp;quot; engineering retreat. Historically our
engineering retreats have been happening as in person retreat, e.g. last
year the engineering group met up in Phoenix, AZ. This year we're experimenting
with a &amp;quot;remote&amp;quot; retreat. We still receive the goodness of a retreat such as
food budget and significant other's gift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Python and the community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to wrap up the mentored sprint for diverse beginners. I'm supposed to
send out thank you emails and feedback forms. I've started email draft,
and my teammates have started reviewing, but I haven't had time to address
them yet. I will try finish this up this weekend!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to wrap up Python Language Summit with Łukasz. We sent out thank you
emails along with link to the feedback form. Some feedback started coming in.
Lots of great ideas and definitely lots of room for improvement for both of us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started chatting with Nathaniel about bots and automation for Trio project. He
has lots of interesting ideas! I'm excited to help him build the bots! I plan
to allocate some of my free time next month (June) to work on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was alerted about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2019-May/006728.html"&gt;miss-islington being broken&lt;/a&gt;. 😟
I think this is a problem with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Redis&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;celery&lt;/tt&gt;, but I haven't fully figure out
how to fix this yet. So the error is still occurring sporadically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started chatting with Andrew about aiohttp-bot. I'm now a member of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs"&gt;aio-libs&lt;/a&gt; team! 😄&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started chatting with Elaine on how to best manage, triage, and handle
info &amp;#64; pyladies dot com email address. We've set up GMail filters. We're splitting
work, taking turns tending the mailbox every 2 weeks.  I've set up some
Slack bots and automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt; has been accepted by
steering council! It means we &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; going to move to GitHub issues.
Now we need to work on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0588/"&gt;PEP 588&lt;/a&gt;
to outline the technical details of the migration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interview with a journalist about Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started chatting with Paul Everitt about doing a webinar for PyCharm.
Stay tuned!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talked to different people about CoC issues happening in the different
communities I'm in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started chatting with Eric about PyCascades. We met with Sage Sharp to get
professional advice about CoC handling in our community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="etc"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;etc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Lots of chores at home! 😛 We still have lots of unpacking to do. Most of our
belongings are still distributed among many boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Made lots of return trip to our old home. We had different contractors coming
in to do repairs. Hoping to get it all done end of the month, so we can put
it up for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Went on a hike around &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.buntzenlake.ca/"&gt;Buntzen Lake&lt;/a&gt; with my family. 🏞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Made lots of dumplings 🥟. I think we're now stocked up for a couple months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Doing last minute planning and preparation for my travel next week 😵&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;I watched Street Food on Netflix, the Yogyakarta episode. This episode brought
tears to my eyes. I choked up each time I heard (and see) the old lady, Mbah
Satinem, speaking and telling her life story. I didn't quite understand
why initially, but I think I do now. For the first time in a long time, I was
able to feel immediate connection with someone on TV. The way she speaks,
it was just so familiar, like someone I've known forever. It was real
Indonesian spirit, not an act, no drama. I think I finally understand
what it means to feel &amp;quot;represented&amp;quot;. I know that all of this sounds weird to
most people.... 🤷🏻‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="python-language-summit-2019"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python Language Summit 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language summit was a success. First of all, we were able to stay somewhat
on time, which I'm personally quite happy about. Other thing to be proud of,
it was the most diverse audience I've seen. Our audience consists of, not just long-time
Python core developers, but also new contributors as well as members from
the wider Python ecosystem, such as from Twisted, Django, and BeeWare project.
We had talks about circuit Python, team communication, and mentorship. I personally
think all the talks were very interesting and refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've invited A. Jesse Jiryu Davis to cover the event. You can see his posts
at The PSF's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-2019-python-language-summit.html"&gt;official blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We forgot to take a group photo after the summit!! 😱 but we had a group photo
with PyCon staff ... (image from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/pystar/status/1123782745585483776"&gt;PyCon's twitter account&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Since Jesse is writing up the post about it, I won't duplicate the effort.
But you can see &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/mariatta/pep-581"&gt;my slides here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd really like to see us making progress with this before the next Python
Language Summit. There were lots of action items, and things we still need
to figure out, but those will be addressed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0588/"&gt;PEP 588&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to update PEP 588 with the items raised during the language summit,
I really haven't had much time to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hands-on-intro-to-aiohttp"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hands-on Intro to aiohttp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Svetlov and I gave a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us-pycon-2019-tutorial.readthedocs.io/"&gt;beginner tutorial to aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;.
Our tutorial material is available online, and licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew is the maintainer of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/"&gt;aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;, which
is licensed under Apache 2.0, He's very knowledgeable about it.
There were lots of interesting questions being asked at the tutorial, and he was
able to explain things clearly. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/matrixise"&gt;Stéphane Wirtel&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/webKnjaZ"&gt;Sviatoslav Sydorenko&lt;/a&gt; volunteered as our TA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D56v23uWAAIfE2Q.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="don-t-be-a-robot-build-the-bot"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't Be a Robot; Build the Bot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday after the keynote, I gave my talk titled &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xdEAxLuj9Y"&gt;Don't Be a Robot; Build the Bot&lt;/a&gt;.
I loved giving that talk! It's a talk about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/"&gt;miss-islington&lt;/a&gt;!
I think more people should be building their own bots and automate! With
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gidgethub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;gidgethub&lt;/a&gt; (Apache 2.0 licensed)
it is really easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="github-bots-are-one-honking-great-idea-let-s-do-more-of-those"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub bots are one honking great idea, let's do more of those!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sviatoslav and I hosted an open space on Sunday. We discussed more about GitHub bots,
building it for profit or for fun. Sviatoslav just made a new framework for building
GitHub Apps with Python 3.7, called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://octomachinery.dev/"&gt;octomachinery&lt;/a&gt;.
We also discussed about GitHub Actions, tried to make sense of it, e.g. what were
limitations, and what Actions would be useful. There is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/official-github-action-for-publishing-to-pypi/1061"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt;
for making an &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; GitHub Action for publishing to PyPI. Some people shared
ideas of what bots they'd like to see and build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One attendee (I think his name was Anurag Saxena(?)) said he'd like to
receive weekly updates of GitHub issues/PRs they
worked on, and to have it automatically sent to him as email or slack or
something. I think this is very interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product placement: this can be accomplished with Zapier. You can create a
cron job that generates the summary (by utilizing GitHub Search API), and then use
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://zapier.com/apps/webhook/integrations"&gt;Webhook by Zapier&lt;/a&gt; to handle the
&amp;quot;send email/post a slack message&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="status-of-black-out"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Status of black-out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned my personal bot, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mariatta/black_out"&gt;black-out&lt;/a&gt;, in
my talk. Black-out is a GitHub bot that runs black (Python formatter) on incoming pull
requests. The first version of the webhook-based bot is open source and Apache 2.0
licensed. However, I wasn't happy with how it works, so I've been researching on
how to turn it into a GitHub App.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made some progress with black-out GitHub App, I've implemented some of the features
I wanted for myself, but I'm still just experimenting and testing it out on my
own personal projects to really figure out what's the best workflow for the bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black-out GitHub App is still closed source, I have not put it up on GitHub yet.
After the talk, a few people, including &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/jezdez"&gt;Jannis Leidel&lt;/a&gt;
from Mozilla, expressed interest in black-out, and wanted to know how they can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the interest! I think I just need to find time and put it up on GitHub
so we can all collaborate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="aiohttp-bot"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;aiohttp bot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aiohttp needs a bot just like miss-islington, for backporting, and Andrew Svetlov
had talked to me about this since early last year. (and Ansible needs their own
backport bot too). To help with this, we've been working to make &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker/"&gt;cherry-picker.py&lt;/a&gt; customizable. I've offered to help
build this bot for aiohttp, and the easiest is a webhook-based bot, just like
miss-islington. However Sviatoslav disagrees. He prefers for it to be a GitHub
App that can be easily installed by other projects. While I like the GitHub App
idea, for reusability, I also think that each projects might have different workflow
for backporting, so we'll end up having to support &amp;quot;configuring the bot&amp;quot;, which is
a boring activity for me. I'll be thinking more about this, but my thinking right
now is to build it as a personal bot for aiohttp; not a customizable bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mentored-sprint-for-diverse-beginners"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mentored Sprint for Diverse Beginners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday afternoon (4 hrs) I helped ran the mentored sprint for Diverse Beginners. This
is a group effort with Tania Allard, Nina Zakharenko, and Nikoleta Glynatsi. We have
a room full of 70 new aspiring open source contributors, and about 30 mentors
from 11 different open source projects (like CPython, CircuitPython, TensorFlow,
etc) I think it was great success! The projects and mentors were tasked with
coming up with at least 5 beginner friendly issues, so they came prepared. Lots
of people with diverse background made their first pull requests at the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that surprised me, was such great turnout! I've organized lots of
events and meetups, and we usually expect about 60% people will actually show up.
But for this event, &lt;strong&gt;EVERYBODY&lt;/strong&gt; showed up! Room was completely full!! (103 pax capacity)
We even had to turn away many people who wanted to walk-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YRJD9tkQSHZBzFcB9" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keynotes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keynotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to see pretty much all of the keynotes, except for Jessica McKellar's keynote.
Her keynote started late, and I was supposed to staff Zapier's booth at the same
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sha's talk was very inspiring and emotional. I'm glad I was able to watch the
talk in person. I was going to suggest people to catch his talk, but unfortunately
there was no recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also enjoyed the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/8dDp-UHBJ_A"&gt;Steering council plenary session&lt;/a&gt;
moderated by Ewa Jodlowska. (there was mention about PEP 581!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycascades"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCascades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D50oSeaXkAEb-uv.jpg:large" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I met up with several PyCascades organizers and we discussed the planning of
next year's conference. We're still scouting venues in Portland, and figuring out
how to best divide tasks among the organizers. Eric Holscher will be co-chairing,
along with Esti. Somehow during that meeting, I became the next PyCascades
Diversity Chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pyladies"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyLadies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D56C8oTX4AESrtq.jpg:large" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(image from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/1125485680216485888"&gt;Lorena Mesa on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I attended a meeting with other PyLadies organizers from all over the world.
We shared notes about organizing and leading our own local chapters. We learned that
the challenges faced by PyLadies in different parts of the world are different. We
talked about how the current representation of PyLadies isn't very diverse (represented
by people in North America) whereas members of Python community and PyLadies are coming
from all over the world. We talked about ideas on how PyLadies can be better. We
discussed the governance of PyLadies, and decided to do a monthly PyLadies organizers
meeting. Elaine and I volunteered to take over managing info at pyladies email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dep-9"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DEP 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into Andrew Godwin who is a Django Core Developer. I got to ask him about
Django and asyncio. During the aiohttp tutorial, someone had asked about aiohttp
and ORM. Andrew Svetlov mentioned that it is a low priority for aiohttp, and so
I wondered what is Django's stance on this. Andrew (Godwin) shared his plan about
async-capable django. I guess he was talking about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin/status/1126328701593866240"&gt;DEP 9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="language-summit-retro-and-the-inspiration-for-black"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Language Summit retro, and the inspiration for black&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met with Łukasz Langa to celebrate success of running our first language summit.
We had informal retros, and started thinking about how to put the next year's event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to ask him where the inspiration for black came from. He described
frustration with other auto-formatter, how it does not provide consistent
output (same file reformatted twice would give different result). After months
of frustration, he decided to make his own auto-formatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D55tCx_W0AAT3tF.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="f-string-debug-mode"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;F-string Debug Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I had to give away all of my new f-string stickers to Eric V. Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric showed me a demo of debug mode for f-string. It adds the &lt;cite&gt;=&lt;/cite&gt; to the f-string
expression. I recalled we had this discussion with both Eric and Larry Hastings back during core Python sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
foo=5 print(f&amp;quot;{foo=}&amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would print:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
foo=5
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then the PR has been merged, and now we need to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue36858"&gt;write the documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D551XvfW4AImG49.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="people"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got to meet in person with people I've interacted online a lot, like:
Tania Allard, Cheryl Sabella, Anthony Shaw, Sviatoslav Sydorenko, Elizaaveta Shashkova,
and many more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D56eogZW0AAUZat.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coc-incidents"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CoC Incidents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the conference, it was brought to my attention about several CoC incidents
that occurred in various communities I belong to. These issues are being dealt
with, and I've also talked to PyCon incident response team members where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ice-cream-selfie"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ice Cream Selfie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had ice cream sandwich from Cathy's Gourmet Ice Cream Sandwiches, courtesy of Tania and Nina 🍨😝🤳🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D568l3_WsAE3pF7.jpg:large" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="pynutella"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyNutella&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyNutella, a.k.a that thing where Mariatta asks her friends who are coming to
PyCon to bring her Nutella from Europe, yeah that happened. Thanks to Christian
Heimes for the very special Nutella. My kids were mind blown to see them. Also
thanks to Stéphane Wirtel for a really big jar of Nutella from Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5l36DKW4AAsgKP.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pierogicon"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PierogiCon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Ossowski, Jeff Triplett and I went back to Sokolowski's University Inn for the
second PierogiCon, and we brought in a number of newbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d67f75c6b92d5fe66cb81e3dc124e539/5D660D3C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/59183211_108900943546171_9078212037958768043_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="selfie-sprint"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Selfie Sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was meaning to do one day of sprints, but after a full week full of activities,
I decided not to do any open source activities, and instead just go around
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;vertical=default&amp;amp;q=mariatta%20%23selfiesprint&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;take selfie with people I met&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed doing Selfie Sprint! I think I will do it again next year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D56wr4nW4AcVeL6.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="seafood"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seafood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to see my brother for dinner. We had really great spicy seafood at Boiling Seafood Crawfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/21ef88439f3331f9aa4990f886749903/5D6E3634/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s750x750/57488426_1264143830402264_5360864775533430374_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fyvr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="award"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Award&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest highlight for me is receiving my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-north-star-of-pycascades-core.html"&gt;Community Service Award&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.
Thank you Python community for this recognition! (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4IfFLAX9hY"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Until next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to include as many memories as I can into this post, but I'm unable to include
everything. 😥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon 2019 has been inspiring. I learned a lot about the community, and I cried
a lot too (the good cry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and all the wonderful Python community for these memories.
Let's do this again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🌮&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;: Attend all the keynotes. Sviatoslav Sydorenko and I plan to do
an open space at 11 AM, with topic: &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Bots are one honking great idea --
let's do more of those! Let's talk about building GitHub Apps as a community&lt;/strong&gt;.
PyLadies lunch. Receive my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-north-star-of-pycascades-core.html"&gt;PSF Community Service&lt;/a&gt;
award. Dinner with my brother. This might be the last time in many years
before I'll get to see him again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;: Sprint! Probably try to catch up with all the things I've been missing
out since I went OOOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Go home!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ice Cream Selfie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So unlike me, I have not decided where to go for &lt;a class="reference external" href="../pages/ice-cream-selfie.html"&gt;Ice Cream Selfie&lt;/a&gt;!!
😱 Last year I went to &lt;a class="reference external" href="../ics-pyconus-2018.html"&gt;Mitchell's Homemade Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Last Friday I received a number of error alerts for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/"&gt;bedevere-bot&lt;/a&gt;. Initially I ignored these alerts
because I was supposed to be on hiatus from open source. However after
two days, errors were still continuing to happen, blocking the workflow.
PRs couldn't be merged. So I spent some time figuring
it out, read the logs, and finally &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/pull/163"&gt;deployed the fix on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked with Łukasz to finalize the lineup for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/"&gt;Python Language Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Sent out notification
emails. Product placement: I used Zapier to send out emails to 50 people

&lt;li&gt;I noticed a regional Python community is putting out their first conference,
and their speakers are all white men. 💔 Hurts to see this still happening
in 2019. I don't even know what to say anymore. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/987450414298685440"&gt;I've said what I had to say

was cherry-picker v 1.3.0 was buggy, so I spent time working on it.
Released &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker/"&gt;cherry-picker v 1.3.1&lt;/a&gt; as

Then we found the chords to Savage Garden's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/WQnAxOQxQIU"&gt;Truly, Madly, Deeply&lt;/a&gt;,
and we played it together. It was real fun! I asked if we can try &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/HCm6gRHINqA"&gt;To The Moon and Back&lt;/a&gt; next time 😛&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Found the YouTube playlist for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gara-Gara"&gt;Gara-Gara&lt;/a&gt;,
an Indonesian sitcom from the 90s. Started watching episodes 1-4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kairopark.jp/android/en/"&gt;Pocket Academy&lt;/a&gt; on my phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While on the way to register our kids to their new school, we got stuck in traffic
for more than two hours. From the internet I found out that there was a crash
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tricitynews.com/news/f-350-bursts-into-blames-on-lougheed-hwy-1.23665719"&gt;a vehicle got on fire&lt;/a&gt;.
When the traffic cleared, the school was already closed. So I have to return back
after spring break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got sick just when the weekend started. 🤧😷🤒🤕 I was pretty much bedridden yesterday.
Feeling better today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Set up a (Zapier-powered) bot that automatically posts to Twitter whenever
someone signed up for the mentored sprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt; to python-dev.
So far, people seem supportive. This will be discussed at the language summit at PyCon US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proposed that we &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/proposal-create-bug-triage-team-on-github/992"&gt;create the &amp;quot;Bug Triage&amp;quot; team on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/using-cla-assistant-for-python/990"&gt;Notified Python contributors&lt;/a&gt;
that I plan to turn on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cla-assistant.io/"&gt;CLA assistant&lt;/a&gt; as our CLA enforcement.
I'd like to see this done before I go on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/mariatta-will-be-ooos-out-of-open-source-starting-march-18-may-9th-2019/973"&gt;OOOS&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;strong&gt;especially&lt;/strong&gt; before the mentored sprint at PyCon US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started reading all the anonymous feedback about PyCascades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1102710078556131328"&gt;Time Timer I ordered from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;
arrived. I plan on using this to timebox discussions at the upcoming Python
language summit, so we don't go overtime. Because I really want to attend the
PyCon staff dinner happening right afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interviewed about &amp;quot;things I'm up to in open source&amp;quot;. Well, I'm in such weird
and unique place right now; all I want to talk about is PEP 581. I hope the
journalist finds PEP 581 exciting. 🙂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details about OSI election hit slashdot. It was emotionally draining, and I
started questioning the choices I made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="etc"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;etc.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gossiped with internet friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Called several movers to get quotes. We might just end up renting a big truck
and move by ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax season has started! 😱 Collected all of my receipts and gave them to my
accountant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detox from Twitter 📵&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's still a big hole 🕳 on the ceiling of my living room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We got more snow and hail! ❄ Twice this week I had to scrape off ice from car
that was parked outside. Sending kids to school was taking longer than usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling unwell (mentally). I've had several meltdowns earlier in the
week. I think the stress from various things in my life are finally
catching up, and as it turns out I'm still unable to manage my life accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Took the kids to the bank and opened their own bank account. I showed them how
to use the ATM. So now they have some place to stash their hong bao. 🧧
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;First step towards self independence!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, as my husband said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talked to our kids that they're vaccinated for measles, explained how
shots/vaccination works, and told them they don't need to worry about getting
sick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Merged Thea's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Mariatta/enhanced-coc-hotline/pull/27"&gt;PR to the enhanced CoC hotline&lt;/a&gt;.
SMS is now supported, and we tested the CoC Hotline and Texting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helped with the pre-registration event, signed people up, and ate some tacos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was a member of the Code of Conduct committee. We had several incidents.
The committee will be publishing a transparency report in the coming weeks.
Shout out to other CoC committee members: Thea, Amanda, Maelle, Russell, and Eloisa.
I've learned so much from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gave a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yvJKTGbbYCpMQ_CuZ-Vfvc_SiyuYmshLZwk8Q3FJ-xk/edit"&gt;lightning talk&lt;/a&gt;
about the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/"&gt;Mentored Sprint at PyCon US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I looked after PyCascades twitter account and hashtags. I missed out attending most
talks, but thanks to all the live tweets, I felt like I was up to date!! It sounds like
you all had great time at PyCascades, and I love reading about them! We
were trending in Seattle!! Achievement unlocked!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I gave the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uROcwz_CZbuWvcPuzCeiFnB4Q6EHfBsDqiA21651yWQ/edit#slide=id.p"&gt;closing remarks&lt;/a&gt;
and appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impromptu photo shoot with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/veronica_hanus"&gt;Veronica Hanus&lt;/a&gt;.
I love &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1100844919134908416"&gt;all the photos&lt;/a&gt; she took!! 😍&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formed the Tequila Think Tank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had way too much tequila than I'm willing to admit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've prepared my own PyCascades post-mortem notes. The team will meet next week
for the post-mortem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sent out post conference survey. (Sorry for one little typo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repurposed the PyCascades Code of Conduct hotline into the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Mariatta/enhanced-coc-hotline/pull/31"&gt;PyCascades virtual
head office hotline&lt;/a&gt;.
Thanks Seb for this idea! Basically we all need a phone number for PyCascades
but none of us wants to share our personal phone number. Thanks to Nexmo
for providing us with credit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprinted and helped several people with their PRs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Small bug fixes and readying for our product launch!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shout out to Doug Mahugh, who responded to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1100923656446783488"&gt;my desperate plea of help on twitter&lt;/a&gt;! 🙇🏻‍♀️
Doug is a two-time PyCascades attendee. He shared me a photo of his laptop.
It was shiny with F-string and PyCascades stickers!!  💜😭&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Booked my flights to Zapier's summer retreat. Sadly, the retreat is happening
on the same week of Python Core Sprint in London. I've thought about splitting
time of half week with Core Python team, and half week with Zapier, but in
the end I've decided to prioritize my work. I'm sad to miss the sprint
this year, but I'll be spending the week in the hometown of Prince: Minneapolis!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended a D&amp;amp;I roundtable discussion. I'm really glad that we have this going
at Zapier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="pycon"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked with Łukasz and finalized the language summit &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/forms/pexfOGDjpV0BWMer2"&gt;sign up forms&lt;/a&gt;.
We announced to mailing lists, Discourse, Zulip, twitter, etc. Updated the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/"&gt;PyCon's website&lt;/a&gt;
about the language summit. Reached out to people who had inquired about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote to PSF Community mailing list about the mentored sprint.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I realized it was getting close to spring break, and therefore to my planned
OOOS. So I wrote to Python committers about my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/mariatta-will-be-ooos-out-of-open-source-starting-march-18-may-9th-2019/973"&gt;upcoming OOOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.opensource.org/bin/Main/OSI+Board+of+Directors/Board+Member+Elections/MariattaWijaya2019"&gt;candidate for OSI board of directors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opened an issue at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences/issues/89"&gt;python-organizers/conferences&lt;/a&gt;.
This was briefly discussed with David and Anthony from ReadTheDocs during PyCascades
sprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responded to several emails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm honored to have been awarded &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-north-star-of-pycascades-core.html"&gt;The PSF Community Service Award 2018 Q3&lt;/a&gt;.
The blog post came out right before PyCascades about to begin, and it was
all too overwhelming. Only now I'm able to digest this all. Thank you,
Python community for this honor. I can do what I do only because you've
been there for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="etc"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;etc.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I now own mariatta.dev. Nothing to see there for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last week we made an offer to a new home, and it was accepted. So we've
been super busy with paperwork, working with our realtor, bank, and accountant.
😵 I can't believe this! I'll be moving to a new place in a couple months.
It has my DREAM KITCHEN!!!! If I ever need to quit tech, I'm going to start
my own Youtube cooking channel right from that kitchen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A home restoration team came and made a big hole on the ceiling of my living
room. 🕳 They will come back next week to complete the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued practising guitar. We tried a new song: the Beatles' Let it Be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Took a nap on Saturday. And Sunday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

many little details! I see them actively Slack-ing all the time! 加油 Almost there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion with CoC committee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up CoC hotline. I will do some testing tomorrow, making sure people getting
dialed properly. I also still need to look at Thea's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Mariatta/enhanced-coc-hotline/pull/27"&gt;PR to the enhanced CoC hotline&lt;/a&gt;.
It will support inbound SMS! 📱 I really want to see this feature land!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A very kind PyCascades member made a generous donation to ReadTheDocs. Thank you!
I merged &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pycascades/welcome-wagon-2019/pull/16"&gt;the PR for switching the welcome wagon's alabaster theme&lt;/a&gt;
to another theme. I think the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pycascades-welcome-wagon-2019.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;new theme is looking great&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helped with announcing the pre-conference social, setting up the ticket page and
added &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pycascades-welcome-wagon-2019.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#pre-conference-social"&gt;the menus&lt;/a&gt;)
to the welcome wagon. As per tradition, we'll be having tacos! 🌮 Also thanks
to the rest of the welcome wagon team, Nick, Andrew, etc for contributing
lots of quality content!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some administrative things, answered emails, Slack-ing, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, I will bring f-string related stickers!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots and lots of things are happening last minute 😳 A friend joked that perhaps
we should have Netflix film us for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Days_Out"&gt;7 Days Out&lt;/a&gt;.
I didn't know about this show before, but perhaps we'll do it for next year! 😛

Thanks Sviatoslav for the PR and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/andrew_svetlov"&gt;Andrew&lt;/a&gt; for the review.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/webKnjaZ"&gt;Sviatoslav&lt;/a&gt; has been working
for this PR for quite some time. This will make it easier for other projects to adopt
cherry-picker (and maybe their own version of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington"&gt;miss-islington&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yes! Language Summit will happen! No, we don't have sign up forms yet! I'm sorry!
I'll have more time to devote to this once PyCascades is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now sign up for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/68/"&gt;Hands-on Intro to aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;
tutorial! Come for the async, stay for the io! Or should it be the other way around?
Come for the io, stay for the async? 🤔 Anyway, we'll work with asyncio
in this tutorial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't get to do much work on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/"&gt;mentored sprint&lt;/a&gt;
either. From the signups so far, seems like people are wanting to contribute to machine
learning and data science-related project. We have a couple open source project
maintainers signing up to mentor!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My husband and I have been thinking of upsizing our home. Kids are growing up.
They still share a room now. My husband also works from home, so we've been
wishing for extra space for both our home offices. We went to view several
houses last week. One home was just amazing and perfect in every way, and the
price was right. We fell in love right away, and so we made an offer. Been busy
trying to gather lots of paperwork and hoping the bank will lend us the money for it.
🤞 It's exciting and at the same time scary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some back and forth email communication with a local meetup organizer lead
me to write &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1097199037583773696"&gt;a twitter thread about about women's representation in open source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Entering the last two weeks before the conference. Lots of little details still being sorted out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pycascades-welcome-wagon-2019.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;welcome wagon&lt;/a&gt;.
Lots of updates to the travel guide …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the first of my Weekly Updates post. &lt;a class="reference external" href="../pages/weekly-updates.html"&gt;Background on this topic&lt;/a&gt;.
I'll try my best to keep this up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PyCascades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entering the last two weeks before the conference. Lots of little details still being sorted out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pycascades-welcome-wagon-2019.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;welcome wagon&lt;/a&gt;.
Lots of updates to the travel guide and dining guide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considered using a different theme than alabaster for the welcome wagon. There's
a PR with a new theme, and it's looking great. But I felt somewhat uncomfortable
to switch to another theme that doesn't support Read The Docs' ethical advertisement.
I recommended PyCascades to support RTD some other way if we're going to not
use the theme anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entire team has continued to working tirelessly. Being a remote organizer,
sometimes I feel like I'm just the &amp;quot;Chief Nagging Officer&amp;quot;, keep asking them about
things, and not actually able to do anything. So all I can do is cheer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We finally secured a sprint venue. I updated the welcome wagon with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pycascades-welcome-wagon-2019.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sprint.html"&gt;sprint info&lt;/a&gt;,
and added &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ti.to/pycascades/pycascades-2019/with/senvon2fuek"&gt;registration ticket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huddled with the CoC committee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An attendee raised a concern about our venue accessibility. Discussed with Maelle
and Thea. We updated the Accessibility page with a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2019.pycascades.com/accessibility/"&gt;fragrance free consideration&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="core-python-workflow"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Core Python Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ned Deily pinged me about an issue with bedevere's &amp;quot;check News&amp;quot; status. It wasn't
working the way we liked, and was blocking a PR from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/11779#issuecomment-462498706"&gt;getting merged&lt;/a&gt;.
So I made a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/pull/152"&gt;PR to quickly fix it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While working on that issue, I realized that the GitHub bots have not been tested
against the latest Python versions, due to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/9069"&gt;known issue in Travis CI&lt;/a&gt;.
We have been testing against Python 3.7.0a4, and we weren't even testing against
Python 3.8. So I went ahead and adjusted the travis configuration files and made
sure they're tested against 3.7.2 and 3.8.0. If you're curious,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/blob/5bb398ed02be63b461551fdfe365eb9e090053a3/.travis.yml"&gt;here's an example of how to configure Travis CI to test against the latest Python versions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One thing lead to another. Now tests are passing in Python 3.7.2 but failing in
3.8.0. We're not sure if the regression is with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;aiohttp&lt;/tt&gt; (3rd party library)
or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;asyncio&lt;/tt&gt; (Core Python). Currently waiting for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3606"&gt;Andrew to investigate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asked in Python committers on how to proceed with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/what-are-next-steps-for-pep-581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merged several PRs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up netlify to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/devguide/issues/463"&gt;preview pull requests in Devguide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PyCon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got news that my talk has been accepted! Happy to reprise my talk, &amp;quot;Don't Be a
Robot; Build the Bot&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Booked my flights and hotel. I'm going to arrive on Monday, April 29 (11 PM or
so). I'm hoping that'll give me to adjust to jet lag (yeah I know.. I'm old)
and a lot of time in case I need to chat with Łukasz about the language summit,
or with Andrew about our tutorial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mentored Sprint at PyCon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/"&gt;Mentored Sprint at PyCon&lt;/a&gt;
was announced last weekend. Thank you Tania, Nina,
and Nikoleta for working together and including me into this effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up forms are now live. Now it's time to start promote the event and get more
signups. I've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/action-needed-participate-in-mentored-sprint-at-pycon-us/868"&gt;posted to Python core developers&lt;/a&gt;
that I would like for them to sign up and mentor. Thank you core developers for
committing to mentor!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the moment, we have a number of contributors signing up, but no projects other
than core Python has signed up yet. Our team are now discussing strategies to
promote and reach out to more audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Baked brownies for kids' Valentine day school party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schools were closed because of the snow! Not a big deal since I work from home.
So I have two little &amp;quot;interns&amp;quot; working with me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote a really large check to pay for my own self-employed income tax to CRA.
Feels good to be able to do it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fun topic arised in PyLadies Slack, about debugging with 1/0 in Python. This
is something I learned from Ned Batchelder's talk, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nedbatchelder.com/text/machete.html"&gt;Machete-Mode Debugging&lt;/a&gt;.
Sometimes you just want to test and debug, and see if your code is running and
reached the part that you want it to reach. There are several ways to do this.
You can &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;raise Exception&lt;/tt&gt;, you can add things like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;print(&amp;quot;here&lt;/span&gt; it is&amp;quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;, you can
write a unittest, you can even write to log file. But those aren't as simple as
typing out mere 3 characters: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;1/0&lt;/tt&gt;. This for sure will cause your program to
stop (because nobody ever really tries to catch the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ZeroDivisionError&lt;/tt&gt;) and bonus,
you get full stack trace. Now you're debugging! Of course NSFP: Not Safe for
Production 😛).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last month, a kind Pythonista (who had read my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/interview-mariatta-wijaya/"&gt;interview in RealPython&lt;/a&gt;) sent me
paypal payment, for me to spend it on ice cream. I've just gotten around buying
a tub of Matcha Ice cream from T&amp;amp;T Supermarket. I haven't had this in a long
while! It's so good! 😋&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It was quite a year! Not quite like 2017, but quite remarkable in its own way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of things happened. Mostly good things. Some bad things, but definitely
it was a net positive year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still quite a busy year, but I feel mostly good about it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still quite a busy year, but I feel mostly good about it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some mistakes, but proud of a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="starting-new-at-zapier"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting new at Zapier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My start date at Zapier was about two weeks before PyCascades. Perhaps, I should've waited until after PyCascades wrapped up before starting a
new job. I found myself needing more time to adjust and ramp up to my new work
environment, new team, new responsibilities, new everything. It took longer than
I'd like before I really feel like I'm getting a hang of my new job. I'm grateful
that Zapier has been understanding and accommodating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycascades-2018"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCascades 2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put out PyCascades! It was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;! It was amazing! I'm really proud of it.
I'm proud of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2018.pycascades.com/schedule/"&gt;all of our speakers&lt;/a&gt;.
I'm proud to have hosted &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2018.pycascades.com/talks/bdfl-python-3-retrospective/"&gt;the creator of Python&lt;/a&gt;.
I'm proud that we filled the theatre. I'm proud that our speakers got the audience
they deserve. I'm proud that our community is enriched by the talks we chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the one thing that I'm most proud of, is our organizing team. Who would have
thought that somehow, this team of people with different backgrounds,
coming from different countries, living in different cities, somehow, &lt;em&gt;we made it work&lt;/em&gt;.
Since day one, the PyCascades team has done nothing but completely support, respect, and trust
one another. I can't ask for a better team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seb, Bryan, Eric, Alan, and Don, I feel lucky that somehow you've all included me
into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conferences"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conferences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than PyCascades, I went to three other conferences: PyCon US, DjangoCon, and
North Bay Python. I presented a tutorial and a talk at PyCon US, as well as a couple
talks at Python Language Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm real honored to have been invited to as keynote speakers at DjangoCon and
North Bay Python. Both of these communities now have special places in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received four other invitations to give keynote at conferences, from faraway places, places
I've never been. But unfortunately I had to decline them. Not because
I didn't want to speak there, but I just couldn't take any more time away from my
family and my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="travels"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Travels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't get to visit many different countries this year, but I visited many new
places in the US. For Zapier-related travels, I visited Hilton Head Island,
Phoenix, and Chattanooga. For Python-related events, I visited Cleveland, Bellevue,
Petaluma, and San Diego. We spent a week in Cancun for spring break. I went on a
solo road trip in the summer. I drove around Oregon and Washington, I went to Mount
Hood and Mount St. Helens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="it-me"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It me!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/after-years-of-abusive-e-mails-the-creator-of-linux-steps-aside"&gt;an interview with Noam Cohen from The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;.
I was quite nervous about it initially. I felt kinda silly about it now, but I had
to admit, I didn't know much about The New Yorker, so I had to ask a couple American friends
of its reputation. My excuse was that I'm an immigrant and I don't follow
American media. Anyways, (and I feel lucky to have them as friends because they didn't judge!),
they all said that it is a great opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't even know why I had to be nervous about it. I guess this is something
I can brag about to my future descendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="black-out"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Black_out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working on a new side project, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mariatta/black_out"&gt;black_out&lt;/a&gt;.
It was very much inspired by my experience developing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington"&gt;miss-islington&lt;/a&gt;.
Black_out is a GitHub bot that runs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; on pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've learned many new things by building black_out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make black_out happen, I needed a new feature to be implemented in gidgethub,
that is the ability to be authenticated using JSON web token. Because
I wanted this feature in gidgethub, I ended up &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brettcannon/gidgethub/pull/62"&gt;writing the PR&lt;/a&gt; myself.
Short story is, this is done, and it's been included since gidgethub 3.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little longer story: writing the tests and maintaining 100% coverage
was quite an adventure! There was one part where I just didn't know how to write the test case for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the test that I started writing (see picture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/gidgethub_test_case.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to come up with a test case for an async generator &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;gh.getiter()&lt;/tt&gt;, where
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ValueError&lt;/tt&gt; is raised if both &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;oauth_token&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;jwt&lt;/tt&gt; are passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I wrote it initially, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;coverage&lt;/tt&gt; reported that there was no coverage there, and
I didn't know what I needed to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I contacted the maintainers of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;coverage&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;asyncio&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pytest&lt;/tt&gt; for advice,
in case they've come across similar situation before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ned commented that it seemed odd to use &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pass&lt;/tt&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then experimented doing it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
    gh.getiter(&amp;quot;/fake&amp;quot;, {&amp;quot;extra&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot;}, oauth_token=&amp;quot;my oauth token&amp;quot;, jwt=&amp;quot;json web token&amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it resulted in an error: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Failed: DID NOT RAISE &amp;lt;class 'ValueError'&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then suggested to &amp;quot;just use nocover pragma&amp;quot;. Yury suggested using
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pytest.fail&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pass&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brettcannon/gidgethub/blob/b260304d3feec022c9890e12b5bdd6bff4c51029/gidgethub/test/test_abc.py#L250-L254"&gt;end result&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
    async for _ in gh.getiter(&amp;quot;/fake&amp;quot;, {&amp;quot;extra&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot;}, oauth_token=&amp;quot;my oauth token&amp;quot;, jwt=&amp;quot;json web token&amp;quot;)
        pytest.fail(&amp;quot;Unreachable&amp;quot;)  # pragma: no cover
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-first-pep-and-second"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My First PEP (and second)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a PEP for the first time: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt; - Using GitHub Issues for CPython. I've
been working on it for some time since earlier this year, but before I got the
chance to announce it, Guido announced his retirement as Python BDFL. I'm happy
for him. His retirement also meant that there was no one who could pronounce
on PEP 581.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then wrote &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8011/"&gt;PEP 8011&lt;/a&gt; - Python
Governance Model Lead by Trio of Pythonistas, co-authored
with Barry Warsaw. PEP 8011 was not top choice among core developers, and I'm fine with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-things-to-be-proud-of"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other things to be proud of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/blurb_it"&gt;blurb_it&lt;/a&gt;, and learned how to
use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp-jinja2"&gt;aiohttp-jinja2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp-session"&gt;aiohttp-session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major improvements to miss-islington include: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/51"&gt;automerge backport PRs&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/146"&gt;automerge any PR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/59"&gt;improved test coverage&lt;/a&gt;, and finally dropping &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;requests&lt;/tt&gt; dependency
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/186/files"&gt;using pure gidgethub and aiohttp to make requests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started learning to play guitar, fulfilling a lifelong dream of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I facilitated and provided speaker mentorship during PyCascades CFP period. Several
of the mentees got their proposals accepted. The proposals were great to begin with.
I'm just proud to take part in their success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="disappointment"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disappointment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my oldest child was born, I kinda promised myself that I'm going to be a
a good parent and not miss any of their school performances and sporting events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day that both of my children performing in their school musical, an Alice
in Wonderland production, I was not at home. Instead, I was at Python Language
Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, it seemed like an obvious choice. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; the language summit was
more important than my children's school performance. That's what I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been feeling guilty about missing their school performance. I can only hope to
somehow make it up to them in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="years-ago"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;20 years ago ...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;content &amp;amp; trigger warning: trauma / PTSD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Phoenix, I met up with an old classmate. A friend I haven't seen for more than
20 years. I haven't seen her since maybe junior high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things she asked, was if I remember &amp;quot;the riot&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it strange that, after not meeting for more than 20 years, this was
one of the first things she asked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess, the riot affected her too. Whether it affected her in the same way it
affected me, I don't know. I don't even realize how it affected me until quite
recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; riot. &lt;em&gt;Kerusuhan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Indonesian people old enough to remember, the riot means one thing: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia"&gt;the
riots of May 1998&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember it. I don't remember how it started, or how it ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember parts of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... the time when myself, my brothers, my parents and grandparents, we were
all gathered in our kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember, being told to pick up one of the kitchen knives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... being told not to be afraid. To be &lt;em&gt;ready&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the rioters came in, &lt;em&gt;stab&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... &lt;em&gt;holding the knife&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... &lt;em&gt;being afraid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They never managed to come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several days, we were on the run. One of my uncles' friend sheltered
us in his house. The grownups told us that we'd be safe there. We'd be safe there,
because it is a Muslim's house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't understand what was happening at the time. I didn't even understand why
we'd be safe in a Muslim's house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I remember ... feeling confused. And betrayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The riot? Yeah, I remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd rather forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="mental-breakdown"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mental Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;content &amp;amp; trigger warning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of good things happened this year, and yet, I got hit with a wave of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mental health had been slowly deteriorating since ... some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does it even matter when it started?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been going on for a while, and I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; what was happening. Yet I ignored the
signs. I kept telling myself, that I can handle it. &lt;em&gt;I've been through this before&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can take care of myself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that ... I wasn't actually taking care of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF8IJsxeNLM"&gt;I was flying so high. But I needed to fall.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself in the darkest place I've ever been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during my road trip that I realized just how dangerous it was for me to
be alone with only my thoughts. My thoughts wandered deep into dark places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I shouldn't be behind the wheels!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I caught myself with those dark thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I hated myself for thinking those thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thoughts keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it went on ... and on ... in cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took ... &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, to try to pull myself back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY7K4uBV4Wc"&gt;The monster you were running from is the monster in you.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't been seeing my therapist for some time, but I've started seeing her again.
My doctor prescribed antidepressant medication. It took several trials, but we
found the medication that works. It comes with some side effects, but, at least,
I'm a functioning human being again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="managing-identities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing Identities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, I've been finding it increasingly difficult to manage all
of my different identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My roles and responsibilities as a parent, are quite different than the roles
and responsibilities as an employee, a conference organizer, a meetup organizer,
a Python core developer, an open source contributor, or a speaker, each of these roles
has different responsibilities and priorities. Sometimes, there is overlap. Sometimes,
there's contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't actually always know, which hat I'm wearing at any given time.
I don't always know, which hat do people see when they see me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that I've picked the right hat at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I always know, which hat is the right hat to wear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And do I still get to be just &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt;? What am I? &lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; am I? Who do I want to be?
What do I want to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still trying to figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="looking-forward"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that I've done this year, everything I've accomplished, I didn't do it on my own.
I received lots of help, support, and encouragement from various people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel ... lucky, that I have all of these friends. I don't take this for granted. I
worry that my luck will run out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's not worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 is now in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 is here now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds cliché, but I want to workout more and actually use the gym membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to keep up learning to play guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want for PEP 581 to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to visit at least one new country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to work on more GitHub bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lots of ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are additional discussions and projects that I got involved with during the
sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pep-581"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PEP 581&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt; is a PEP I wrote about using
GitHub issues instead of Roundup as CPython's issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sprint, I discussed this topic mainly with Ezio …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Read up on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mariatta.ca/core-sprint-2018-part-1.html"&gt;Part one&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are additional discussions and projects that I got involved with during the
sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pep-581"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PEP 581&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/"&gt;PEP 581&lt;/a&gt; is a PEP I wrote about using
GitHub issues instead of Roundup as CPython's issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sprint, I discussed this topic mainly with Ezio Melotti, as well as
with a group of other core devs: Ned Deily, Kushal Das, Petr Viktorin, Pablo Galindo,
and one-on-one with Zachary Ware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks all of you who came and discussed this with me, I really appreciate your
input and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting back, my tone might have been unkind, impatient, and unempathetic during
certain parts of the group discussion, and I'm sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most other PEPs, the idea for this PEP did not go through rounds of
discussions over at python-ideas. And unlike other PEPs, I did not post this PEP
into python-dev after it has been written. It was my own choice. Instead, this idea
was discussed at Python Language Summit, as a thread at python-committers, and
I also chatted privately with a few other Python core developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezio, who maintains Roundup for CPython, talked to various core devs individually
to get a sense whether people are warm to the idea of moving to GitHub. It seems
like people are postive about it, or at least not strongly opposing the idea,  but
we still need to iron out additional details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the concerns raised during the discussions with core devs at
the sprint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if GitHub disappear suddenly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that my response to this question had been unkind, impatient,
unempathetic, and I'm sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response was &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I don't care&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really meant is, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I don't believe GitHub will go away all that suddenly&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;,
and that is my personal opinion, and I know there are people who thinks otherwise,
and I respect the difference in opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the actual question needing actual answer is: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What is our fail safe plan?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.
This is something that the PEP needs to address. At the moment, we'll just going to get
daily backups of GitHub data. But eventually we will need a more concrete
plan and we will need to be able to easily spin up another issue tracker / repository
so Python world does not stop and people can continue
contributing and developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this problem is not unique to CPython. Lack of fail-safe solution should
not blocking the PEP's acceptance, and should not stop us from using GitHub issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about current bug triage permission?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Roundup currently, we have a separate &amp;quot;bug triage&amp;quot; permission that is different
than the core developer / commit access. The bug triage permission allows them
to close and categorize issues on the issue tracker, but does not give the
permission to commit or merge pull requests to CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug triage permission is definitely valuable for the team. Historically,
we've been able to give this permission easily to people without much formality,
whereas giving commit access is not so trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We definitely need bug triage help, and the question is, how will this be managed
with GitHub?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple ideas. Donald Stufft commented in Zulip that we can give
people write access, invite them as team collaborators, this will allow them to
edit and close issues, but use the GitHub branch protection feature to restrict
pushing codes to only Python core developers. BTW, we have been using this
feature, just didn't quite realize it. Python &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;3.4&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;3.5&lt;/tt&gt; branches on GitHub
are currently &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot;, and only the release manager, Larry Hastings, can
push codes to those branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we can do is to invite the current bug triagers as collaborators for
CPython repository, give them that write access, and add branch protection
such that only Python core developers can push / commit into the active branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea that came up while chatting with Zach, now that miss-islington
can automerge, maybe we let only miss-islington to merge and commit from now on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nosy list&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Dower commented that one nice feature of the existing issue tracker is
the nosy list, where he can get notified only in issues he's interested in. For
example, if someone creates an issue with &amp;quot;Windows&amp;quot; component in the current issue
tracker, he and Zach will be automatically notified and added to the nosy list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not yet similar functionality on GitHub. So we're going to build out a
bot that does this somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started researching GitHub's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/notifications/"&gt;notification and subscription APIs&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't have
clear idea or solution to this problem yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involve the Python Release manager in the transition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ned Deily, Release Manager for Python 3.6 and 3.7, reminded us that we will need
to include the release managers for any changes in our workflow and issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub can lower the barrier to contribute, but also makes it easier for people to submit unrelevant issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some core devs were concerned that the ease of using GitHub can also mean easier
for people to use and abuse it for things other than discussing bugs and features of
Python. It means that we will need to spend more time into triaging issues, marking
things as off topic, duplicate, telling people to file their issue somewhere else,
and so on. I think this is a valid concern. But I think this is an existing problem
anyway, regardless of what issue tracker we use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gitmate.io/"&gt;GitMate.io&lt;/a&gt; myself.
One of Gitmate's ability is to identify if an issue is a duplicate of other previously
reported issues. GitMate is currently installed in devguide, core-workflow, and
miss-islington repos. I've seen it help several people, but sometimes it is not
so helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CoC enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to have better and clearer policy on CoC enforcement for handling comments
on GitHub. I know that there is the PSF's CoC work group now, and Brett is part of that
group. I'm glad that there is some progress, and I look forward hearing more from the
CoC work group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cla"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CLA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of CPython's workflow that could use an improvement is the way we
handle CLA (Contributor License Agreement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it works, for every contribution and pull request you made to Python
(CPython, DevGuide, PEPs, core-workflow, and all the bots), you'll need to
sign the CLA before we can accept and merge the pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently several problems with this workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signing the CLA also requires creating an account in the bug tracker. So
people making pull requests on GitHub needs to go to bugs.python.org, create
an account, and then add in their GitHub username. While this makes sense
for contributors to CPython, there is really no reason for contributors to
DevGuide or cherry-picker to do this. It just slows down the process of
contributing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires manual work by members of The PSF (Ewa and Betsy) to check if the CLA
has been signed, and they have to manually update the record in bugs.python.org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the CLA has been signed, the pull request does not get automatically
updated with this new information. Contributors used to have to ping a core
developer to update the label on the PR, and a core developer has to come back
to the PR and remove the label. This has gotten better recently, with the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://check-python-cla.herokuapp.com/"&gt;check-python-cla&lt;/a&gt; website. But it
still is somewhat manual process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could take at least a day, sometimes more, for the CLA process to clear. It
blocks pull requests from being merged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really would be nice if this whole process can be automated, not requires much
human involvement, and if it can be completed in seconds instead of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been discussing this issue with Brett since early this year. I've also
started a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/mm3/archives/list/core-workflow&amp;#64;python.org/thread/JBV3XJVD2DLDX5DY7TZEA6CO5YPNHJ2C/"&gt;couple threads&lt;/a&gt;
in core-workflow mailing list. Per Yury's suggestion, I've started looking into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cla-assistant.io/"&gt;cla-assistant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sprint, I got to discuss this more with Brett on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal preference is actually use the hosted version of cla-assistant,
so we don't have to maintain it. (&lt;strong&gt;We&lt;/strong&gt; here really means only myself, Brett,
and Ernest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People expressed concern that the system could go away quite suddenly, so
we're going to need to have some fail-safe mechanism if that ever happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the problem of &amp;quot;what if this goes away suddenly&amp;quot; is not be unique problem
to Python. I'm now actually curious to hear from other projects that use hosted
cla-assistant, and if they have their own backup plan in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted with Ernest, and he said it will be easy enough for us to host our
own instance of CLA assistant. Ernest has started looking into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several outstanding issues with cla-assistant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it handle people who signed on behalf of an organization?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows us to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant#request-more-information-from-the-cla-signer"&gt;request more information from the CLA signer&lt;/a&gt;,
but when we export the data, the additional metada were not returned. It seems
like a bug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we get daily backups automatically? It seems like the only way to get the
backup is by going to the website, and click on a menu item that says &amp;quot;Export&amp;quot;.
Is there an API endpoint we can use, or do we need to build it ourselves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we export out current signed CLAs from the bug tracker to cla-assistant?
Ezio had actually started working on getting me a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.csv&lt;/tt&gt; for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran out of time and energy to follow through with all of the above during the
sprint, so sadly we're still not yet using this new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Brett, Ernest, and Ezio for looking into this with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fake-f-strings"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fake f-strings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I selfishly wanted Larry to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/283"&gt;drop Python 3.5 support&lt;/a&gt; in blurb. Blurb was
initially written with f-strings, but later on, all f-strings were replaced with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/pull/146"&gt;str.format&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been quite disappointed about it since last year, and I know I actually
have better things to do than being sad about a tool so crucial for CPython does
not have any f-strings in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Larry entertained my selfish request and came up with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/pull/288"&gt;fake f-strings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take it. Thanks Larry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="real-f-strings-and-asyncio"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real f-strings and asyncio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until the sprint, I had never tried doing something like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;f&amp;quot;{await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;somecoroutine()}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;,
so I didn't know if it would even work. Since the creators and maintainers of
f-strings and asyncio are in the room, I thought I'll just ask them if it can work,
and I should get a quick firm &amp;quot;yes/no&amp;quot; answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was slight hesitation from core devs in answering such question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It should work?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I think so?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Brett wrote us a small script to see if it will really work, with myself and
Eric V. Smith as witness. The result is, this works for Python 3.7+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out later that it does not work in Python 3.6, but I don't actually know
the reason why. Something changed with how &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;await&lt;/tt&gt; works between 3.6 and 3.7?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤷🏻‍♀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Yury &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/1st1/status/1042858310641152001"&gt;commented on twitter&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;yes, this needs Python 3.7+ to work. Before 3.7 async and await were not proper
keywords, so the interpreter did not recognize them in some contexts.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Yury! Now we have new reason to start using Python 3.7+!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="to-be-continued"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To be continued&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be Part 3, &lt;em&gt;someday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I was only able to stay for the sprint for three days. This year
I'm able to stay for the entire week. I got a lot more things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Steve Dower, for organizing this sprint and figuring out all the
logistics for us. Coordinating this is no easy task, and everything runs smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big thanks to Microsoft for hosting us in Reactor Redmond B20. The facility and the
campus was really awesome. (Ice cream at the back of the room!) I got to
try out the Hololens! Thanks for treating us for a nice dinner, with guest speaker
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg"&gt;Anders Hejlsberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to The PSF for providing the fund, getting many core devs from all over the
world. It's been valuable being able to spend the whole week collaborating and
talk face-to-face. We really don't get too many opportunities to do this. Sprints
at conferences are normally our opportunity to help onboard new contributors
to Python. Core sprint like this serves a different purpose where we get to focus
on some of our bigger projects, brainstorm with each other, and make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Zapier, especially my manager, and my teammates at the Partner Engagement
Team, for being supportive and giving me the time away from work. Zapier has
flexible time off policy, so I'm not limited to only taking X days off from work
each year. In addition, I get to focus on Python for the whole week, and not
needed to keep doing daily standup or weekly team meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my family, for supporting and being able to manage themselves while
I'm away. I have been traveling away without them, for work and for Python, once
a month each month since January of this year, and even more of such trips that's
been arranged all the way until August 2019. It really has not been easy for
all of us. But it motivated me to make the most of my time at the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the core developers who came, away from their home, from their family and work,
for Python. We had many great discussions and chats during the past week, they've
all been very productive, and I really enjoyed being able to spend time with everyone
for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="new-python-core-developers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Python Core Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome Emily Morehouse-Valcarcel and Lisa Roach as new Python core developers!
They're both brilliant, and have been &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-September/006059.html"&gt;contributing to Python&lt;/a&gt;
in the past couple years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="miss-islington"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miss-islington&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;miss-islington is a GitHub bot that first developed at last year's core sprint.
The original task of miss-islington was to automatically create backport PRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, she gained new privilege. She's been allowed to merge her own PR once
it has been approved by another core dev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, miss-islington gained a new superpower. She can now automatically
merge any pull requests that core dev wants her to merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As context, there had been long and lengthy discussion about this &amp;quot;automerge&amp;quot;
ability. Discussion started in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/29"&gt;core-workflow issue #29&lt;/a&gt;,
opened by Donald Stufft February 2017. It is one functionality that GitLab
has that improves productivity, that GitHub does not yet provide. And as indication
of how complicated CPython workflow is, further discussion about this spilled over to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/issues/14"&gt;bedevere issue #14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have come to the resolution and decision of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere/issues/14#issuecomment-399585735"&gt;how the automerge&lt;/a&gt; should
work, I guess I just have not find any time to completely focus and work
on implementing it. I spent almost the whole day of the first day of sprint
to implement this. I don't normally have that &amp;quot;one full day to focus and undisturbed to work on Python&amp;quot;
thing, so needless to say, I might never get this done without coming to the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're curious of how this was implemented, miss-islington is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;.
In addition, I will give a keynote speech at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2018.djangocon.us/news/mariatta-wijaya/"&gt;DjangoCon US 2018&lt;/a&gt;,
titled &lt;strong&gt;Don't Be a Robot; Build the Bot&lt;/strong&gt;
where I plan to describe some of miss-islington's architecture and challenges in
building it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the pull requests related to automerge feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/146"&gt;Automerge PR labeled with &amp;quot;automerge&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/151"&gt;Normalize commit messages on automerge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/pull/152"&gt;Don't automerge if there is &amp;quot;DO-NOT-MERGE&amp;quot; label and &amp;quot;CLA not signed&amp;quot; label&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open issues that we will need to address, eventually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/issues/153"&gt;Rate limited since the automerge has been deployed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/issues/155"&gt;Keep track of who triggered the automerge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/issues/154"&gt;Miss-islington should not self-assign PR that failed to backport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington/issues/159"&gt;automerge shouldn't let GH wrap the first line of the commit message&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also read my announcement to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-September/006043.html"&gt;python-committers&lt;/a&gt; about the automerge,
as well as watch a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/p85YtKKLNno"&gt;YouTube demo video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="blurb-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blurb it!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of our requirement for every pull requests that you send to CPython, is a news
entry describing the change. This had been heavily discussed and designed in
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/6"&gt;core-workflow issue #6&lt;/a&gt;,
and we now have Larry Hasting's tool, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/blurb/"&gt;blurb&lt;/a&gt;
(available on PyPI), to help with this. In addition, we have a status check in place
by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/bedevere"&gt;bedevere&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that the news
file exists, and that we don't forget to add it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry's blurb works really great, and everyone has been using it without issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal nitpick about this, is that (and it's because I'm very lazy), blurb
is a command line tool, and so I have to be on my computer in order to use it.
A lot of time, I found myself reviewing a pull request while on my phone,
and all it needed was a news entry. But since I was on my phone, on transit,
by the beach, or whatever, I could not complete this process, and had to
wait until I'm back on the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been thinking that it would be nice and convenient if there was a web
interface for blurb. A place for me to fill in a form, and the news file automatically
gets added to the pull request. I had asked Larry earlier at PyCon what he thinks
about this idea. He said that he's okay with it, and he had in fact &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-June/148448.html"&gt;mentioned it himself&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;... it should be easy for
some JavaScript expert to write a static page that generates blurb files
for you--it provides a form, you fill it out, and you &amp;quot;download&amp;quot; the
blurb file.  (I've seen pages that do that sort of thing, though I don't
know how to write that kind of JavaScript myself.)&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; (python-dev, June 24, 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don't actually know how to write that kind of JavaScript either, I wrote
it all in Python 3.7, using fine libraries like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aiohttp-session.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;aiohttp-session&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aiohttp-jinja2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;aiohttp-jinja2&lt;/a&gt;, asyncio, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gidgethub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;gidgethub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting to write this project, I needed to come up with a project name,
and of course it was the hardest part of the process. I had thought of unimaginative
names like, &amp;quot;Blurb on the web&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;blurb_ee (ee: extended edition, pronounced &lt;em&gt;blurbee&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;quot;.
Gregory P. Smith suggested &amp;quot;Blurb 2.0&amp;quot;. It sounds okay, except that I'm not actually implementing
a new &amp;quot;blurb&amp;quot;. I'm trying to provide an enhancement of &amp;quot;blurb add&amp;quot; command, so it
is only a subset of the full &amp;quot;blurb&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Blurb 2.0&amp;quot; sounds incorrect to me. Larry
himself suggested: &amp;quot;webLurb&amp;quot; (pronounced webblurb, or maybe we blurb?). In the end,
I went with, &amp;quot;blurb_it&amp;quot;, to which Guido responded: &amp;quot;ship_it&amp;quot;. 🚢&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I demoed the prototype of blurb_it at Microsoft meetup on Thursday. I've started
a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/blurb_it/pull/2"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;, and currently
it is available on my own free Heroku instance at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://my-blurb-it.herokuapp.com/"&gt;https://my-blurb-it.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still more work to be done for blurb_it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add travis CI integration to the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer app ownership to The PSF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it as a GitHub App instead of an OAuth App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add form validation that the news entry has to be more than 30 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for Andrew's feedback on best practises when using aiohttp-session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="to-be-continued"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To be continued&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all the time I have to write up about the sprint. I'm heading back to
Vancouver, and will be out-of-open source for the rest of the month. But I plan
to continue with more details of some of the other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mariatta.ca/core-sprint-2018-part-2.html"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Zapier for fully supporting my trip to PyCon, and for allowing me to
take the time away from work for more than a week. The significance of this, for
me personally, is that for the first time I didn't need to apply for financial
aid in order to attend PyCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Zapier's support, I was able to stay for two days of sprints. It means
I get to contribute for open source for &lt;strong&gt;two full days&lt;/strong&gt;! 😆🌮&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-language-summit"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python Language Summit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the Python Language Summit for the second year. This time I presented
two topics. I had planned to do a lightning talk too, but by end of the day
I was too exhausted, so no lightning talk from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language summit was open to Python core developers, and by invitation only.
There was no recording, however there will be an article by Jake Edge from LWN.
I presented two talk topics at the language summit. I'll leave you in suspense
as you await the LWN article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little side anecdote, when I first became a Python Core Developer last year,
a couple core devs and a BDFL each told me about the language summit. And each
one of them &lt;strong&gt;warned&lt;/strong&gt; me of a certain &lt;em&gt;incident&lt;/em&gt; happened at the language summit in
the past. To protect the identity and the integrity of the folks involved, I won't
say what the incident was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, I kept hearing of the same incident mentioned by several
other core devs. So I came to think of it as an urban legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might have been two new urban legends born at Python Language
Summit 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tutorial"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tutorial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/ZwvjtCjimiw"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; at PyCon. I think it went quite well.
I definitely can be a better instructor next time, but I believe the attendees had
fun and learned many new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to thank my friends for coming and helping out at my tutorial. Many attendees
faced technical difficulties, and I would not have been able to attend to them
one by one. Really, it would not have gone as well without their help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So thank you friends: Jane Williams, Matt Davis, Ned Deily, Victor Stinner,
Stéphane Wirtel, Eric V. Smith, Christian Heimes. You're all the best!
Thanks Carol Willing and Guido van Rossum for dropping by, and special thanks
Brett Cannon for the cameo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="talks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/hhj7eb6TrtI"&gt;What is a Python Core Developer&lt;/a&gt;.
Poured my heart out, and felt really good afterwards. Thank you
everyone who came to my talk, (and for the standing ovation 🙇🏻‍♀️).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only managed to go to a several keynotes and talks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITksU31c1WY"&gt;Dan Callahan's Keynote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprint"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt quite productive during the sprint days!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of two days I made these contributions to open source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Released &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker/"&gt;cherry_picker v1.1.1&lt;/a&gt; to PyPI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussed the documentation for PEP 557 with Eric V. Smith and Ned Deily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slacked off too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still found time to chat and gossip with other folks during the sprint days.
Thanks Ned Batchelder, Anna Ossowski, Jeff Triplett, Ernest W. Durbin III, and Guido
van Rossum for being available and lending their ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="regret"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regret&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had wanted to help writing the documentation for PEP 557, the dataclasses module.
In the end I was not able to help with anything. Thank you Eric V. Smith for
writing up the proper documentation. Check it out &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/dataclasses.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric also gave me a crash course of the dataclasses module. No better way to
learn about it from the creator himself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rainbow-roses"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rainbow Roses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered a dozen rainbow roses to be delivered to my hotel room. They're very
lovely. I think I will make this a new ritual. 🌹💐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the roses didn't make it, that's why there are only eleven in the photo. 😛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/pycon2018-rainbowroses.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="poison"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Poison&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, I had 11 shots of tequila over the period of 7 days. Eric Holscher
started to make a comment about it and James Bond and martini... 🤐
&lt;em&gt;I'm much less exciting than James Bond!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At dinner one evening with Victor and Guido, I didn't see tequila on the menu.
So we ended up with this cute drink that has only 12% alcohol. 😭&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/pycon2018-cutedrink.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wat"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wat?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Beazley included &lt;cite&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;F&amp;quot;Yes!&amp;quot;&lt;/cite&gt; in his &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/995343478015102976"&gt;talk slides&lt;/a&gt;.
I didn't realize that he'd been reading my tweets. 🤭&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of people who proudly wore their PyCascades t-shirt at PyCon truly amazed me.
Thank you!!!
🙇🏻‍♀️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the folks who said hi and told me that they know me by reputation...
🙇🏻‍♀🙇🏻‍♀🙇🏻‍♀🙇🏻‍♀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="photos"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other favorite memories from PyCon 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The dessert at PyLadies lunch (on Mother's Day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/pycon2018-pyladieslunch.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;PyCascades founders, 4 out of 6: Sebastian Vetter, Don Sheu, Eric Holscher, and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/pycon2018-pycascades.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Met up with my brother and we ate lots of seafood at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="www.boilingseafoodcrawfishoh.com"&gt;Boiling Seafood Crawfish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/pycon2018-seafood.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;I didn't recognized my hero at first (never met him in person until PyCon), but he
recognized me. 🙈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/pycon2018-hero.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Python Language Summit chairs handover/initiation meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/pycon2018-languagesummitchairs.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;My luggage was searched by the TSA. 🛃 #PyNutella&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="../img/pycon2018-pynutella.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="until-next-time"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Until next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to include as many memories as I can into this post, but I'm unable to include
everything. 😥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to chat and met with many many more people: all the Python Core Developers,
Python BDFL, open source project maintainers, PyLadies members, speakers, and various members
of this community. It's been inspiring and I learned a lot from all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon 2018 had been very very busy, intense, special, and lovely. Thank
you organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and all the wonderful Python community for these memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🌮&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, thank you to everyone who gave me lots of moral support about this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt kind of guilty at first. I was worried if my non-activity would mean
that other Python core devs will have to pick up the slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's give more credit to the core devs! Python has flourished for 20+ years
without my involvement. One month without me is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-still-did-some-volunteering"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I still did some volunteering&lt;/strong&gt; 😥&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these I sort of anticipated, many were unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Released cherry_picker v1.1.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had offered to help Andrew Svetlov with building a GitHub bot similar to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington"&gt;miss-islington&lt;/a&gt;, but for maintaining
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp"&gt;aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the work
needed to be done is to make cherry_picker customizable for other projects.
Andrew had made the necessary code changes, but there was one small bug.
All I needed to do was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/pull/233"&gt;review the PR&lt;/a&gt;,
approve it, and publish the fix to PyPI. It didn't take
too much of my time, so I was quite happy to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadowed Larry and Barry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound cryptic, but I'll leave it at that for now. I'm also not quite
sure how it came to be, but this was something the BDFL asked me
to do. Who am I to say no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organized a PyLadies Vancouver meetup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping my co-organizers could take care of this for me, and I wished I
didn't have to be involved. But we were having trouble finding a sponsor who would
host our April meetup. (I will rant about this in detail some other time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached out to at least five companies, and even tried booking a free meeting room
at Vancouver Public Library. Our requests were either denied or ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked other meetup organizers and several Python friends in town for help. In
the end, we pushed the event to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/events/249657234/"&gt;May&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/CiscoSecurity"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; stepped up to host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got myself invited to yet another community Slack channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to our difficulty with finding a meetup venue, the experience
prompted me to reach out to the other meetup organizers in town. One group
I talked to called themselves the Gastown Gang. Previously, they had lured me in with
promises of pasta. 🍝😋&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No pasta yet, but we had been talking about a new initiative for shared
resources among the local meetup communities in Vancouver,
how things can be more transparent and open, and how the different communities
can help and support each other. Somehow this ended with me joining a new community
Slack team. 😛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volunteered to write the docs for PEP 557: Data Classes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue32216"&gt;volunteered&lt;/a&gt; to do it a couple
months ago, but never got around doing anything. After a gentle ping from an
eager member of the community, I emailed Eric and Raymond to see if we could
sprint on this at PyCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I engaged with the community, on Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok maybe &lt;em&gt;engaged&lt;/em&gt; was not the right word. More like, ... &lt;em&gt;provoked&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expressed my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/987450414298685440"&gt;extreme disappointment&lt;/a&gt;
to the community. I knew the risks and the repercussions for speaking up about
diversity issues. But I did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the twitter broke. I mean, the twitter &lt;em&gt;on my phone&lt;/em&gt; broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having to block three people, I deleted the app for the rest of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read up about PEP 572&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Python core devs told me about this PEP, so I read some of
the python-dev emails about it. &lt;em&gt;Keeping personal opinions to myself&lt;/em&gt;. 🤐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-really-did-take-time-off"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I really DID take time off!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than Andrew's PR, I didn't review any other pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did not read any mailing list emails, except that one thread about PEP 572.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did not follow any issues in the bug tracker, except for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue3692"&gt;bpo-3692&lt;/a&gt;. But that was raised at work, so I don't
consider it as volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read Twitter only for my own notifications, mentions, and direct messages,
up until the weekend where my twitter broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did I do for my own me time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put in extra effort for my work at Zapier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a couple new features shipped! 🌮 They're documented
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/partner-api/#paging-through-results-using-limit-and-offset"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/shared-zaps-test-trigger/#embed-widget-faq"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. 😄
I'm working on a new feature, wanted by several partners. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netflix and ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤭 Eh, ... I watched a lot of shows on Netflix: All 3 seasons of Hannibal, Lucky
Number Slevin, and Troy: Fall of a City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Played Ramen Sensei on my phone&lt;/strong&gt; 🍜&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still under the delusion that I can successfully run a ramen shop if I ever
need to leave tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Went to my oldest son's first piano recital&lt;/strong&gt; 🎹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did great! 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worked on my GitHub Bot tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent two weekend afternoons to work on the tutorial. While I open-sourced
the  material, I don't count this as a &lt;em&gt;volunteer&lt;/em&gt; work since I'll be getting paid
for it at PyCon. Thanks to Brett who reviewed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigated if we could get a pet turtle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not tell my kids about this. After one afternoon of reading how to care
for a pet turtle, I realized I don't really want additional responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watched My Little Pony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My kids are into My Little Pony these days. Not something I'm familiar with. I'm
still learning all the ponies' name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did my taxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procrastinated doing it until pretty much the final day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="stuff-i-wanted-to-do-but-didn-t"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stuff I wanted to do, but didn't&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had been working on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/pull/3306"&gt;pull request for Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. I was planning
to find some time to finish it up, but didn't. 😥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been wanting to do at least some kind of cooking, baking, try out new recipe,
or at least make a batch of handmade noodles. None of that happened. 😕&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My review was requested for a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/pull/238"&gt;bugfix PR&lt;/a&gt;
to cherry_picker. I still haven't looked at it. 😔&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="happiness"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happiness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I received a happiness packet. Thanks Anna. 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Met up with my friends &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/986368161690759168"&gt;Seb and Dan&lt;/a&gt;.
We chatted about the community, about PyCon, and, of course, about how awesome f-strings are.
I also got Dan to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/986360574450651136"&gt;autograph&lt;/a&gt; my copy of his
book! 🤩&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received compliments about miss-islington and my GitHub Bot tutorial.
Thanks &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/nicoddemus/status/980963184189329408"&gt;Bruno&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/webology/status/985167199043235842"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;. 😊&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Found out that my tutorial at PyCon is now full! 😳️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thankful for the supportive Python community. 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-now"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss getting involved in open source, and being part of the community. But I
have other priorities for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still wanting a break from contributing to open source for another month,
except when I'm at PyCon for the sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will however, start getting involved in my local Python community again.
I need to follow up with Gastown Gang, and start planning the next PyLadies Vancouver
meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so looking forward to PyCon! Can't wait for my next ice cream selfie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="things-to-improve"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to improve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past month still felt busier than I wanted to. I'm still thinking up better
ways to do this. 😥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Gmail filters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to adjust the email filters several times to get it right. I think
it is still not optimal. Some emails from GitHub and b.p.o were still going through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some important emails got missed, because the sender uses an email system that always
include the word &amp;quot;unsubscribe&amp;quot;. 🤷🏻‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete twitter on my phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have done it from the get go. I should not even bother with
checking my mentions or direct messages. It got me into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O-O-OS autoreply GitHub bot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking it might be cool to have my own out-of-open source autoreply GitHub
bot. For example if someone mentions me or requested review from me, the bot can
respond on my behalf and let people know that I won't get to it for a while,
so they can find someone else. But I'm worried it'll just add noise to the thread.
More design is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a different month&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll definitely do this again next year. Question is, which month? 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm learning now that the months before and during PyCon are busy times of the year for
a Python core developer. Same as any month where there's a scheduled release it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it be so irresponsible if I choose to be off during those  months?
And do I need to co-ordinate with other core devs so we don't all go on a
break at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is this so complicated?&lt;/em&gt; 🙃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What a year. There might not be another year quite like this one for me.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been ... busy. I want to be less busy in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January, my only wish for this year was to get my talk accepted at PyCon US.
&lt;em&gt;That would be this year's highlight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, a lot of things happened. Mostly good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing all of these down, as a therapy for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycascades"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCascades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got an email from my friend Seb one morning, talked about organizing a Python
conference in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't think twice before saying yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just thought that a Python conference in this part of the world will be great
for the growing Python community here. And it wasn't going to happen on its own.
A person wouldn't be able to do it alone. But a group of people all sharing
the same ideals? It could work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no clue what it's going to involve. I got introduced to the other folks:
Don, Alan, Bryan, and Eric. Don and Alan have build a huge Python community
in Seattle. Eric organizes Write The Docs conference. &lt;em&gt;They know what
they're doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose a name: PyCascades. First one's in Vancouver.
Started looking for a venue. It's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizing PyCascades has been very challenging. Perhaps one day I'll write more
about the challenges. I'm just really proud that I get to be part of it. Lucky
that I get to be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycon-talk-acceptance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCon talk acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about the same time that we started organizing PyCascades, I was notified
that my talk was accepted at PyCon. I couldn't believe it! I read the email
again and again. It felt amazing! It was like a dream come true! I must have told
everyone I knew about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I got scared. &lt;strong&gt;I'm going to be give a non-technical talk at PyCon.&lt;/strong&gt;
Maybe nobody will show up for my talk. Maybe people showed up and then be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative thoughts creeping in. Booked a session with my therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="djangocon-europe-talk-acceptance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DjangoCon Europe talk acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still reveling and freaking out about PyCon, I found out that I've been
accepted to speak at DjangoCon Europe. Florence! I had never been to Europe!
Of course I accepted. My employer wasn't going to sponsor my trip. Submitted
my vacation request. Thanks to DjangoCon Europe's financial aid, I could actually
afford to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-python-core-developer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Python Core Developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I was going to get busy for the first half of the year. And it was only January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a life-changing event happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mentor, Raymond, messaged me. &amp;quot;I have good news for you&amp;quot;, he said.
&amp;quot;I nominated you for core-dev privileges.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you sure I'm ready for this?&amp;quot;, I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not to worry, I'll be responsible for your commits for a while. I'll continue
to mentor, help, and cheer you along the way. You'll be an important part of the
project.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core-dev privileges? What are they? What does it even mean, to be a Python Core
Developer? I guess, technically, somewhere, there's going to be a boolean flag
getting flipped. It's got to be more than that. The commit bit, comes with
special super power. With power, comes responsibility. Right? &lt;em&gt;Right?&lt;/em&gt; Except
I had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted with my other mentor, Guido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Raymond nominated me to be a core dev. What do you think? 'cause I'm not sure I'm
ready for this&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, you'll grow into the role.&amp;quot;, he dismissed my concerns.
&amp;quot;It will be good for Python to have you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure about this??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited. Happy. Scared. Anxious. All at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn't even know how to feel!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, there's a new entry in the Dev Guide of a new Python Core Developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life changed that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-talk-acceptance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More talk acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring time. Got my talk accepted at several other conferences.
I'd love to go to all of them, but my work wouldn't sponsor. It would mean that
I'll have to go on my own dime and take personal time off. I couldn't afford to go.
And I really should go on vacations with my husband and kids instead of traveling by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said no to most of them. I thought I'd be done speaking for the rest of the year
after PyCon US. But then I then I decided to speaking at PyCon Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I went to Australia for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="broken"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between PyCon US and PyCon Australia, I started applying for a new job again.
One rejection email after another. I ignored those emails. I needed to focus
on giving a new talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gave my talk, a talk about f-strings. I felt good about it. Now that it's done, I
finally have time to ponder about those rejection emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat all alone in my hotel room in Melbourne. I thought about what I wanted to
do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still wanted to get a new job. I suppose I should learn from my failures and
try to do better at the next interviews. So I read those emails again. I had asked
the recruiters if they have specific feedback of what I could improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;after reviewing your code, we don’t think you’re exactly the right fit for our role&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could they even determine this simply by looking at my code?
I guess this is just a generic message they send to everyone who failed. They
wouldn't even bother with giving me an honest feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reject email, dated July 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
... we don't think it makes sense to move forward
right now- primarily because we want to see continued growth in your technical skills.
However, we are really impressed with you overall and think you'd be a great culture
fit for &amp;lt;company&amp;gt;. Please keep us in mind and reach out if you'd like to enter the
process again in 1-2 years - we'd love to talk with you then.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What. Is. This.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;we want to see continued growth in your technical skills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the f--- have I been doing in the last 15 years, if not that? What else do
I need to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lost. I didn't know what else I could do to be better at the next interview.
I keep trying to find a lesson to be learned out of this. And I could not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's not technical skill that I lacked. I don't know what they want.
After all these years, I'm still not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke down. Buried my face in the pillow. Cried myself to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next morning came. Took a shower. Negative thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looked at the time. It's time to get going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiped my tears and washed my face one more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still unable to find any positivity. No light. Only darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to the sprint venue. Wrote some code. Replied to emails.
Tried to forget everything. I uploaded &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Mariatta/tic_tac_taco_pizza"&gt;tic tac taco pizza&lt;/a&gt; to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the most useless thing to be in PyPI&lt;/em&gt;. Didn't matter. For once, I
wrote code for myself. My kids would love it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie came over and showed me that she installed tic tac taco pizza and had
played it. Thank you Katie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then went on a road trip with Trey. The Great Ocean Road trip. It was great.
I saw the ocean. I love the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of my sadness, taken by the sea ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-core-sprint"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python Core Sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September. 20 core devs got together for a week. Facebook and The PSF sponsored my trip.
I had a great time. Really enjoyed meeting other core devs and spent time with them.
Because I had spent all of my vacation days, I was only able to be at the sprint
for 3 days instead of the full week. Lame. Wished I could have stayed longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the core devs worked on CPython. New PEPs being discussed. Ezio worked
on the Dev Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington"&gt;miss-islington&lt;/a&gt;, a
GitHub bot to backport changes from master to the other
maintenance branches. We needed this bot since we moved to GitHub months ago.
So far it has backported more than 300 pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="picking-up-the-pieces"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Picking up the pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that I was done for the year. Time to take a break.
Time to catch up on things I'd put off earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike wanted me to write for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2017/09/25/pydev-of-the-week-mariatta-wijaya/"&gt;PyDev of the Week&lt;/a&gt;
since a couple months ago. Finally got around doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became a guest at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://castalio.info/episodio-114-mariatta-wijaya-cpython.html"&gt;Castalio Podcast&lt;/a&gt;.
I had a lot of fun. I laughed a lot during the interview!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan asked me to write the foreword for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dbader.org/products/python-tricks-book/"&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt;.
Thanks Dan for this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyLadies Vancouver members wanted a workshop about Python Packaging. I thought
of Brett. Brett helped me publish &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; to PyPI for the first time ever.
Asked Brett if he could give a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/events/243207518/"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;.
He agreed. Thanks Brett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2017.pycon.ca/"&gt;PyCon Canada&lt;/a&gt; asked me to give a keynote. What an honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two different friends wanted to nominate me for some kind of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/women-in-open-source"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt;.
Wow! Thanks Gloria and Victor. Don't think I stack up against the other nominees
but it meant a lot that you both thought of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory nominated me for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/10/more-open-source-peer-bonus-winners.html"&gt;Google Open Source Peer Bonus&lt;/a&gt; award. That felt great.
Thanks Gregory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-family-doctor"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Family Doctor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family doctor no longer practicing. So I met with a new doctor. He reviewed
my medical history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I see here you have &lt;em&gt;mood swings&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he didn't want to say the dirty word in front of my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it should not be a dirty word. They probably won't understand it now.
In that split moment I decided that I wanted my kids to hear it.
That this is something we can talk about, openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have depression. And anxieties. Come and go in waves.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you take medication?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. Trying to manage it by seeing a therapist.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That's good. But come to me if you need medication.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I never need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="quitting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quitting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was ready to give up hope and to remain the my current job. A job that was no
longer satisfying. I tried leaving, but had no where else to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three different people had told me about this other company. &lt;em&gt;Great culture, great people. Give it a try!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really didn't think I could handle yet another rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got tired of trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the last time&lt;/em&gt;. That's what I said the time before. For real this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They seemed really nice and friendly. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Great people, great culture.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Will I
belong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They offered me the job. The next day I gave my notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anything we can do to keep you here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I could have asked for more money? For the promotion they denied me earlier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't make me beg for things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you. But I'm leaving.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart is someplace else now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reflecting-back"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflecting back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost a year since I became a Python Core Developer. Still not sure what
it really means to be a core dev. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What is it like?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Busy. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How can I become a core dev too?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;
I dunno. I got lucky. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How much time do you spend contributing?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Way too much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really made lots of contributions to open source and to Python this year.
Wrote a lot of documentation. Wrote some code. Made more than 600 pull requests.
Also reviewed a lot of them. Wrote &amp;quot;Thanks and congrats on your first
contribution to CPython&amp;quot; many many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shiny green &amp;quot;Squash and merge&amp;quot; button is no longer intimidating.
&amp;quot;You can always revert things.&amp;quot;, Brett said early on.
&amp;quot;Don't worry, you won't be breaking Python.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time I thought I had erased the entire history of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not. But I really thought I did. Longest 10 minutes of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned how to revert things on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of things happened this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some good. Some bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018? I only have one wish: that my tutorial gets accepted at PyCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, that sounds familiar ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
