    <p>I'll be super busy tomorrow (traveling down to Seattle for PyCascades),
so here's an earlier weekly update.</p>
<p>Short work week because of a stat holiday. I've been preoccupied with work,
PyCascades, and dealing with tons of paperwork.</p>
<div class="section" id="work">
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Getting ready to launch a project that my team has been working on for more than
half a year. Team has been busy working, testing, verifying and fixing
any issues that comes. Looking forward for the big reveal!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pycascades">
<h2>PyCascades</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Entering the final week before the conference!! The team is still looking after
many little details! I see them actively Slack-ing all the time! åŠ æ²¹ Almost there!</li>
<li>Discussion with CoC committee.</li>
<li>Setting up CoC hotline. I will do some testing tomorrow, making sure people getting
dialed properly. I also still need to look at Thea's <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Mariatta/enhanced-coc-hotline/pull/27">PR to the enhanced CoC hotline</a>.
It will support inbound SMS! ðŸ“± I really want to see this feature land!</li>
<li>A very kind PyCascades member made a generous donation to ReadTheDocs. Thank you!
I merged <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pycascades/welcome-wagon-2019/pull/16">the PR for switching the welcome wagon's alabaster theme</a>
to another theme. I think the <a class="reference external" href="https://pycascades-welcome-wagon-2019.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">new theme is looking great</a>!</li>
<li>Helped with announcing the pre-conference social, setting up the ticket page and
added <a class="reference external" href="https://pycascades-welcome-wagon-2019.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#pre-conference-social">the menus</a>)
to the welcome wagon. As per tradition, we'll be having tacos! ðŸŒ® Also thanks
to the rest of the welcome wagon team, Nick, Andrew, etc for contributing
lots of quality content!</li>
<li>Some administrative things, answered emails, Slack-ing, etc.</li>
<li>Yes, I will bring f-string related stickers!</li>
<li>Lots and lots of things are happening last minute ðŸ˜³ A friend joked that perhaps
we should have Netflix film us for <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Days_Out">7 Days Out</a>.
I didn't know about this show before, but perhaps we'll do it for next year! ðŸ˜›
Any fund raised can go towards more financial aid.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python">
<h2>Python</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Did some administrative things. Nothing too exciting. Answered emails, responded
to random issues etc.</li>
<li>Released <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-workflow/releases/tag/cherry-picker-v1.3.0">cherry_picker v 1.3.0</a>.
Thanks Sviatoslav for the PR and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/andrew_svetlov">Andrew</a> for the review.
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/webKnjaZ">Sviatoslav</a> has been working
for this PR for quite some time. This will make it easier for other projects to adopt
cherry-picker (and maybe their own version of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington">miss-islington</a>).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pycon">
<h2>PyCon</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Yes! Language Summit will happen! No, we don't have sign up forms yet! I'm sorry!
I'll have more time to devote to this once PyCascades is over.</li>
<li>You can now sign up for the <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/68/">Hands-on Intro to aiohttp</a>
tutorial! Come for the async, stay for the io! Or should it be the other way around?
Come for the io, stay for the async? ðŸ¤” Anyway, we'll work with asyncio
in this tutorial.</li>
<li>I didn't get to do much work on the <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/">mentored sprint</a>
either. From the signups so far, seems like people are wanting to contribute to machine
learning and data science-related project. We have a couple open source project
maintainers signing up to mentor!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="etc">
<h2>etc.</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>My husband and I have been thinking of upsizing our home. Kids are growing up.
They still share a room now. My husband also works from home, so we've been
wishing for extra space for both our home offices. We went to view several
houses last week. One home was just amazing and perfect in every way, and the
price was right. We fell in love right away, and so we made an offer. Been busy
trying to gather lots of paperwork and hoping the bank will lend us the money for it.
ðŸ¤ž It's exciting and at the same time scary.</li>
<li>Some back and forth email communication with a local meetup organizer lead
me to write <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1097199037583773696">a twitter thread about about women's representation in open source</a>.</li>
