&lt;p&gt;It was fun visiting San Diego for DjangoCon US 2018. I gave my talk &lt;a href="https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/dont-be-a-robot-build-the-bot/"&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Be a Robot; Build the Bot&lt;/a&gt;.
I think it was well received ðŸ˜Š&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also a special travel trip, because, well it happens that my husband also
needed to travel for work at the same time, so we don&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to look after
our two kids. I ended up taking my kids with me to the conference.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
