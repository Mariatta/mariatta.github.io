&lt;p>It was fun visiting San Diego for DjangoCon US 2018. I gave my talk &lt;a href="https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/dont-be-a-robot-build-the-bot/">Don&amp;rsquo;t Be a Robot; Build the Bot&lt;/a>.
I think it was well received 😊&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was also a special travel trip, because, well it happens that my husband also
needed to travel for work at the same time, so we don&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to look after
our two kids. I ended up taking my kids with me to the conference.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
