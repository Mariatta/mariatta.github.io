I had trouble choosing a flavor because everything looks so good!
Most people don&amp;rsquo;t speak english very well, but I was able to order what I want by pointing at the display 😝

It was an online event, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually get to have ice cream in Colombia. Perhaps one day.
While on a camping trip to Whistler, I decided to get my Ice Cream Selfie at Cows Ice cream, which is a favorite place for us. Each time we&amp;rsquo;re there, there&amp;rsquo;s always a long lineup.

This was an online event, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually go to Thailand for this. However, I found an ice cream flavour that represent Thailand: Thai Coconut Milk Gelato from Bella Gelateria!
Bella Gelateria has one of the best ice cream in Vancouver, they&amp;rsquo;ve won many awards!

It was an online event, so I looked for local ice cream shops where I live.
Snowy Village is my kids favorite place here. They really love the bingsu, which is milk-based Korean shaved ice dessert.
Bingsu counts as ice cream! #IceCreamSelfie 🍦😝🤳 @ Snowy Village pic.twitter.com/ZKqlTZkZUK

All of their ice creams are made from scratch locally, and they have vegan options too.

I joined so many virtual conferences, and at one point, I was a speaker at three different conferences all in one same weekend.
2020 was also, a challenging time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to go out a lot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to do my Ice cream selfie after the conference.
Finally, on new year&amp;rsquo;s eve, we decided to celebrate and go out. While in Robson Street, we stopped by a Korean grocery store and my kids saw some boba milk tea ice cream bar for sale.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCon Australia, and PyCon Taiwan</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pyconau-pycontw/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2020 20:44:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pyconau-pycontw/</guid><description>Rocky Point Ice Cream 2020, the year of virtual conferences for me. I get to speak at two different conferences happening in the same weekend: PyCon Australia, and PyCon Taiwan.
I decided to just get two scoops of ice cream from one shop. This is from Rocky Point Ice Cream.
Thanks @pyconau and @PyConTW for having me!
I gave talk at two conferences in the same weekend so I think I deserve the two scoops of ice cream from @RPIceCream (I picked matcha green tea and espresso flakes flavours)#IceCreamSelfie 🍦😝🤳 pic.</description></item></channel></rss>
