I had trouble choosing a flavor because everything looks so good!
Most people don&amp;rsquo;t speak english very well, but I was able to order what I want by pointing at the display 😝

It was an online event, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually get to have ice cream in Colombia. Perhaps one day.
While on a camping trip to Whistler, I decided to get my Ice Cream Selfie at Cows Ice cream, which is a favorite place for us. Each time we&amp;rsquo;re there, there&amp;rsquo;s always a long lineup.

I joined so many virtual conferences, and at one point, I was a speaker at three different conferences all in one same weekend.
2020 was also, a challenging time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to go out a lot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to do my Ice cream selfie after the conference.
Finally, on new year&amp;rsquo;s eve, we decided to celebrate and go out. While in Robson Street, we stopped by a Korean grocery store and my kids saw some boba milk tea ice cream bar for sale.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCon Australia, and PyCon Taiwan 2020</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pyconau-pycontw/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2020 20:44:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pyconau-pycontw/</guid><description>Rocky Point Ice Cream 2020, the year of virtual conferences for me. I get to speak at two different conferences happening in the same weekend: PyCon Australia, and PyCon Taiwan.
I decided to just get two scoops of ice cream from one shop. This is from Rocky Point Ice Cream.
Thanks @pyconau and @PyConTW for having me!
I gave talk at two conferences in the same weekend so I think I deserve the two scoops of ice cream from @RPIceCream (I picked matcha green tea and espresso flakes flavours)#IceCreamSelfie 🍦😝🤳 pic.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCon US 2020</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pyconus_2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 19:45:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pyconus_2020/</guid><description>PyCon US 2020 was cancelled, but I still decided to record a tutorial for it.
Since everything was still closed down at that time, so I just bought some ice cream and ice cream cones from the grocery store.

I went to Cathy&amp;rsquo;s Gourmet Ice Cream Sandwiches. The ice cream sandwich was really yummy! 😋
I&amp;rsquo;m sad to hear that this place has since closed down.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCon US 2018</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2018/pyconus_2018/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 May 2018 19:56:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2018/pyconus_2018/</guid><description>Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s Ice Cream At PyCon US 2018, I gave my talk What is a Python Core Developer.

My friend Jeff asked if there&amp;rsquo;s anything that would make me feel better, and I said &amp;ldquo;I wanna go get ice cream&amp;rdquo;. So we went to this place that he knew about.
At that time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider Ice Cream Selfie to be a &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; yet, but I think this is when it becomes a real &amp;ldquo;tradition&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ DjangoCon Europe, PyCon Italy 2017</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconit_djangoconeu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2017 16:02:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconit_djangoconeu/</guid><description>Hero image photo by Bartek Pawlik, DjangoCon Europe.
Icy Dot Wine I was just walking around in Florence, having given my talk at two conferences in the same week: PyCon Italy and DjangoCon Europe 2017.
At that time, Ice cream selfie isn&amp;rsquo;t quite a ritual yet, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know which shop this was.
After many years, I tracked down the shop name! This was from Icy Dot Wine.</description></item></channel></rss>
