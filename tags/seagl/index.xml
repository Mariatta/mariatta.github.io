I joined so many virtual conferences, and at one point, I was a speaker at three different conferences all in one same weekend.
2020 was also, a challenging time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to go out a lot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to do my Ice cream selfie after the conference.
Finally, on new year&amp;rsquo;s eve, we decided to celebrate and go out. While in Robson Street, we stopped by a Korean grocery store and my kids saw some boba milk tea ice cream bar for sale.</description></item></channel></rss>
