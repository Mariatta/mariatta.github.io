&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Python core developer since January 27, 2017.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a Python core developer comes with perks, privileges, and also responsibilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes I can&amp;rsquo;t tell whether something is a perk, or a privilege, or a responsibility. I think depends on who
you&amp;rsquo;re talking to, they might see it as an optional nice thing they could get/do, but the same thing might be seen
as &lt;del>burden&lt;/del> responsibility to others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 5</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 20:17:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-5/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="python-core-sprint-2024-day-5">Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 5&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="datetime-and-hypothesis">Datetime and Hypothesis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I reviewed some issues that came to the CPython repo. There were a few interesting tickets related to the &lt;code>datetime&lt;/code>
module. These issues were discovered by Hypothesis, a property-based testing tool for Python.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing a lot about Hypothesis, but never really used it in production or at work. I watched a talk about it
at PyCon US many years ago, and I even had &lt;a href="https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2023/pycon_2023/">ice cream selfie&lt;/a> with Zac who
maintains Hypothesis. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been interested in learning more about Hypothesis and how it could solve issues
not caught by other testing methods, and I think this is one of the perks of contributing to open source: getting exposed
to things you don&amp;rsquo;t normally use at work, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to learn new things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 4</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 20:17:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="python-core-sprint-2024-day-4">Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 4&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>T-strings? Template strings? Has a name been decided yet?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chatted more with Dave Peck and Jim Baker about PEP 750, and they explained in more details about the use cases
in DSL (Domain Specific Language), for SQL and HTMLs. Guido, Lysandros, Jim, and Dave all met today
to further refine the PEP, and it sounds like they have a good plan for it. And a lot of people at the sprint also expressed
their enthusiasm for this PEP. So look forward to the updated PEP!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 3</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 20:17:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-3/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="python-core-sprint-2024-day-3">Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 3&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Today I joined a group to have breakfast at Meta&amp;rsquo;s cafeteria. The cafeteria has an Espresso machine that
we have to operate ourselves. So, I learned how to use the Espresso machine on the spot, and made myself cappuccino.
This was the best cup of coffee I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the last 5 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="t-strings">T-strings&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I chatted briefly with Lysandros about PEP 750. He mentioned that they will be re-working the proposal
based on community feedback so, and also said it will not be called a &amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; anymore, but T-strings, it could look
slightly different than what&amp;rsquo;s shown on the PEP today. Jim Baker should be here starting tomorrow to work on the PEP.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 2</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 20:17:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="python-core-sprint-2024-day-2">Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 2&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I woke up a bit later this morning, so I missed the keynote, but thankfully the online platform
allows me to watch the recording, so I was still able to watch Mario Munoz&amp;rsquo; keynote: How To Be A Developer
and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves. I really enjoyed Mario&amp;rsquo;s keynote. I love it when presenters
find unique and creative ways to present their talk, and Mario really nailed it. His talk was very
heartfelt and full of empathy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 1</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 20:52:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="python-core-sprint-2024-day-1">Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Bellevue for the annual Python core sprint. This year, the sprint is hosted at the Meta
Bellevue campus, and coordinated by Itamar Oren from Meta. Other Python core devs and contributors
who work at Meta are also helping (Dino Viehland, Jason Fried, Matt Page, Parul Gupta, and Thomas Wouters).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The PSF offers travel grants for Python core devs who are participating in the sprint and aren&amp;rsquo;t being
sponsored by their employer, which I signed up for. Thanks to the travel grant, my hotel stay is covered
fully by The PSF.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PEP Talk</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/pep_talk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/pep_talk/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="talk-abstract">Talk Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you use Python, chances are you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of PEP 8, the Python style guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But do you know what PEPs really are? PEPs are more than just a style guide. A PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It&amp;rsquo;s a proposal documentation for when you want to change the Python programming language in a big way, for example when you want to change the syntax of Python. Think of the addition of f-strings, the walrus operator, or the ExceptionGroup, those changes all started with a PEP.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There's an API for That!</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/theres-an-api-for-that/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/theres-an-api-for-that/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="theres-an-api-for-that">There&amp;rsquo;s an API For That!&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Python is one of the most popular programming language out there, and it is also an open source project. The Python community relies on contributions by volunteers, and you too can take part in this rewarding experience. Contributing to open source is not just about opening pull requests. In this talk, weâ€™ll go through the workflow of contributing to CPython repository, as well as other ways to contribute to the project, including documentation, triaging, and infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oops! I Became an Open Source Maintainer! ðŸ˜±</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/oops-i-became-an-open-source-maintainer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 17:09:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/oops-i-became-an-open-source-maintainer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="talk-abstract">Talk Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I consider myself relatively new to the open source world; my first open source contribution was in summer of 2016. Pretty soon I found myself being given commit rights to other peopleâ€™s open source projects. Being a new open source maintainer brings a set of unique challenges that I was not fully prepared for. In this talk, I will share my journey and the things Iâ€™ve learned along the way, and some advice for other aspiring open source maintainers and contributors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is a Python Core Developer?</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/what-is-a-python-core-dev/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/what-is-a-python-core-dev/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="talk-abstract">Talk Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How do you become a Python core developer? How can I become one? What is it like to be a Python core developer?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the questions I often receive ever since I became a Python core developer a year ago. Contributing to Python is a long journey that does not end when one earns the commit privilege. There are responsibilities to bear and expectations to live up to.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
