&lt;p>If you use Python, chances are you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of PEP 8, the Python style guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But do you know what PEPs really are? PEPs are more than just a style guide. A PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It&amp;rsquo;s a proposal documentation for when you want to change the Python programming language in a big way, for example when you want to change the syntax of Python. Think of the addition of f-strings, the walrus operator, or the ExceptionGroup, those changes all started with a PEP.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There's an API for That!</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/theres-an-api-for-that/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/theres-an-api-for-that/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="theres-an-api-for-that">There&amp;rsquo;s an API For That!&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>You might have seen bots like GitHub bots, Discord bots, Slack bots. How do these bots work? There&amp;rsquo;s an API for that! You can use third-party APIs to build web apps and automations, including bots. Come learn the best practices on how to work with APIs using Python.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Python is one of the most popular programming language out there, and it is also an open source project. The Python community relies on contributions by volunteers, and you too can take part in this rewarding experience. Contributing to open source is not just about opening pull requests. In this talk, weâ€™ll go through the workflow of contributing to CPython repository, as well as other ways to contribute to the project, including documentation, triaging, and infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oops! I Became an Open Source Maintainer! ðŸ˜±</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/oops-i-became-an-open-source-maintainer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 17:09:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/oops-i-became-an-open-source-maintainer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="talk-abstract">Talk Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I consider myself relatively new to the open source world; my first open source contribution was in summer of 2016. Pretty soon I found myself being given commit rights to other peopleâ€™s open source projects. Being a new open source maintainer brings a set of unique challenges that I was not fully prepared for. In this talk, I will share my journey and the things Iâ€™ve learned along the way, and some advice for other aspiring open source maintainers and contributors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is a Python Core Developer?</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/what-is-a-python-core-dev/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/what-is-a-python-core-dev/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="talk-abstract">Talk Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How do you become a Python core developer? How can I become one? What is it like to be a Python core developer?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the questions I often receive ever since I became a Python core developer a year ago. Contributing to Python is a long journey that does not end when one earns the commit privilege. There are responsibilities to bear and expectations to live up to.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
