&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2024/cfp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyLadiesCon CFP&lt;/a> is now open until September 15, 2024,
and I would love to support you in submitting your talk.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Perhaps you never gave a talk before, and unsure if speaking for you?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perhaps you want to give a talk, but don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re experienced enough?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perhaps you have a talk idea, but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to turn it into a proposal?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perhaps you tried submitting talks before, but always get rejected and feeling discouraged?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been through all of the above before myself, and I know how you feel. Having a supportive community, and having
mentors who were willing to give personalized 1:1 feedback, have helped me overcome my fears and self-doubt, and be a
better speaker. The PyLadies community is here to support you.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
