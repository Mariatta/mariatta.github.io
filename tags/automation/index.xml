&lt;p&gt;Not sure how common is this practice of giving out certificates to conference attendees. I&amp;rsquo;ve been attending mostly Python-related conferences in North America,
and we don&amp;rsquo;t usually get any certificates here.
However, when I went to Python Brasil in Manaus 2022, they gave me a certificate of attendance.
And as a conference organizer, occasionally I&amp;rsquo;d receive request from a few attendees and volunteers about such certificate, saying that
their employer or school requires it as proof of attendance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
