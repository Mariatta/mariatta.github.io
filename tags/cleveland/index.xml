I gave a talk, a tutorial, and also ran the first Mentored Sprints with Nina Zakharenko and Tania Allard, AND co-chaired the Python Language Summit for the first time üòµ (I ended up co-charing it for 4 years).
I went to Cathy&amp;rsquo;s Gourmet Ice Cream Sandwiches. The ice cream sandwich was really yummy! üòã
I&amp;rsquo;m sad to hear that this place has since closed down.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCon US 2018</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2018/pyconus_2018/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 May 2018 19:56:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2018/pyconus_2018/</guid><description>Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s Ice Cream At PyCon US 2018, I gave my talk What is a Python Core Developer.
