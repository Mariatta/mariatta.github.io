I gave my talk Don&amp;rsquo;t Be a Robot; Build the Bot. I think it was well received ðŸ˜Š
This was also a special travel trip, because, well it happens that my husband also needed to travel for work at the same time, so we don&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to look after our two kids. I ended up taking my kids with me to the conference.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ DjangoCon Europe, PyCon Italy 2017</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconit_djangoconeu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2017 16:02:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconit_djangoconeu/</guid><description>Hero image photo by Bartek Pawlik, DjangoCon Europe.
Icy Dot Wine I was just walking around in Florence, having given my talk at two conferences in the same week: PyCon Italy and DjangoCon Europe 2017.

After many years, I tracked down the shop name! This was from Icy Dot Wine.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ DjangoCon US 2016</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2016/djangoconus_2016/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2016 16:02:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2016/djangoconus_2016/</guid><description>Capogiro Gelato Artisans My first ever conference talk, and my first ever Ice Cream Selfie! The rest is history.
Trio Gelato from Capogiro Gelato: Cappucino, Pistachio, and Bacio.
While my public speaking and ice cream selfies continues, sadly Capogiro Gelato Artisans has since closed down. ðŸ˜¢</description></item></channel></rss>
