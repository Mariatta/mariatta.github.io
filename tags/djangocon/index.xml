&lt;p>It was fun visiting San Diego for DjangoCon US 2018. I gave my talk &lt;a href="https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/dont-be-a-robot-build-the-bot/">Don&amp;rsquo;t Be a Robot; Build the Bot&lt;/a>.
I think it was well received ðŸ˜Š&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was also a special travel trip, because, well it happens that my husband also
needed to travel for work at the same time, so we don&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to look after
our two kids. I ended up taking my kids with me to the conference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ DjangoCon Europe, PyCon Italy 2017</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconit_djangoconeu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2017 16:02:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pyconit_djangoconeu/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hero image photo by Bartek Pawlik, DjangoCon Europe.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was just walking around in Florence, having given my talk at two conferences
in the same week: &lt;a href="https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/dial-m-for-mentor/">PyCon Italy and DjangoCon Europe 2017&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that time, Ice cream selfie isn&amp;rsquo;t quite a ritual yet, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t even
know which shop this was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After many years, I tracked down the shop name! This was from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/AMRSA2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Icy Dot Wine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ DjangoCon US 2016</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2016/djangoconus_2016/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2016 16:02:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2016/djangoconus_2016/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="capogiro-gelato-artisans">Capogiro Gelato Artisans&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My first ever &lt;a href="https://mariatta.ca/posts/talks/making-the-most-out-of-code-reviews/">conference talk&lt;/a>, and my first ever Ice Cream Selfie! The rest
is history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trio Gelato from Capogiro Gelato: Cappucino, Pistachio, and Bacio.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While my public speaking and ice cream selfies continues, sadly Capogiro Gelato Artisans
has since closed down. ðŸ˜¢&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
