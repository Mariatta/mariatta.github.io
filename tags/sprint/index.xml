&lt;p>I woke up a bit later this morning, so I missed the keynote, but thankfully the online platform
allows me to watch the recording, so I was still able to watch Mario Munoz&amp;rsquo; keynote: How To Be A Developer
and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves. I really enjoyed Mario&amp;rsquo;s keynote. I love it when presenters
find unique and creative ways to present their talk, and Mario really nailed it. His talk was very
heartfelt and full of empathy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 1</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 20:52:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/python-core-sprint-2024-day-1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="python-core-sprint-2024-day-1">Python Core Sprint 2024: Day 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Bellevue for the annual Python core sprint. This year, the sprint is hosted at the Meta
Bellevue campus, and coordinated by Itamar Oren from Meta. Other Python core devs and contributors
who work at Meta are also helping (Dino Viehland, Jason Fried, Matt Page, Parul Gupta, and Thomas Wouters).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The PSF offers travel grants for Python core devs who are participating in the sprint and aren&amp;rsquo;t being
sponsored by their employer, which I signed up for. Thanks to the travel grant, my hotel stay is covered
fully by The PSF.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
