&lt;p>This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Bellevue for the annual Python core sprint. This year, the sprint is hosted at the Meta
Bellevue campus, and coordinated by Itamar Oren from Meta. Other Python core devs and contributors
who work at Meta are also helping (Dino Viehland, Jason Fried, and Thomas Wouters).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The PSF offers travel grants for Python core devs who are participating in the sprint and aren&amp;rsquo;t being
sponsored by their employer, which I signed up for. Thanks to the travel grant, my hotel stay is covered
fully by The PSF.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
