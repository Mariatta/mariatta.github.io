My friend Jeff asked if there&amp;rsquo;s anything that would make me feel better, and I said &amp;ldquo;I wanna go get ice cream&amp;rdquo;. So we went to this place that he knew about.
At that time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider Ice Cream Selfie to be a &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; yet, but I think this is when it becomes a real &amp;ldquo;tradition&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCaribbean 2017</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pycaribbean/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:02:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2017/pycaribbean/</guid><description>Puerto Rico Kim Crayton and I went to Condado Beach prior to the conference.
