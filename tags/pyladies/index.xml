Perhaps you never gave a talk before, and unsure if speaking for you? Perhaps you want to give a talk, but don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re experienced enough? Perhaps you have a talk idea, but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to turn it into a proposal? Perhaps you tried submitting talks before, but always get rejected and feeling discouraged?</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCascades 2020</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pycascades_2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 21:26:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pycascades_2020/</guid><description>Fifty Licks Ice Cream Elaine Wong, Lorena Mesa, and I, we gave a talk together about 9 Years of PyLadies.
