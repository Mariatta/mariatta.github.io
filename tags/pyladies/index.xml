&lt;h3 id="datetime-and-hypothesis"&gt;Datetime and Hypothesis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reviewed some issues that came to the CPython repo. There were a few interesting tickets related to the &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt;
module. These issues were discovered by Hypothesis, a property-based testing tool for Python.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing a lot about Hypothesis, but never really used it in production or at work. I watched a talk about it
at PyCon US many years ago, and I even had &lt;a href="https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2023/pycon_2023/"&gt;ice cream selfie&lt;/a&gt; with Zac who
maintains Hypothesis. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been interested in learning more about Hypothesis and how it could solve issues
not caught by other testing methods, and I think this is one of the perks of contributing to open source: getting exposed
to things you don&amp;rsquo;t normally use at work, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Say Thanks to Python People</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/how-to-thank-python-people/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/how-to-thank-python-people/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-python-community"&gt;The Python Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is not just code, but a community. The Python community members contribute in many ways and in many forms.
The obvious ones are code contributions, by maintaining or contributing to the open
source library that you depend on. Other forms of contributions are in the form of documentation, tutorials, educational
content, bloggers, and public speakers. Other kind of contributions that are often unseen and not obvious are
community leaders who run your local Python meetups, and regional conferences.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PyLadiesCon Speaker Support</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/pyladiescon-speaker-support/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/pyladiescon-speaker-support/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="speak-at-pyladiescon"&gt;Speak at PyLadiesCon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2024/cfp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PyLadiesCon CFP&lt;/a&gt; is now open until September 15, 2024,
and I would love to support you in submitting your talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps you never gave a talk before, and unsure if speaking for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps you want to give a talk, but don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re experienced enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps you have a talk idea, but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to turn it into a proposal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps you tried submitting talks before, but always get rejected and feeling discouraged?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been through all of the above before myself, and I know how you feel. Having a supportive community, and having
mentors who were willing to give personalized 1:1 feedback, have helped me overcome my fears and self-doubt, and be a
better speaker. The PyLadies community is here to support you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ice Cream Selfie @ PyCascades 2020</title><link>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pycascades_2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 21:26:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mariatta.ca/posts/ice_cream_selfies/2020/pycascades_2020/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="fifty-licks-ice-cream"&gt;Fifty Licks Ice Cream&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elaine Wong, Lorena Mesa, and I, we gave a talk together about 9 Years of PyLadies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, we went to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/fiftylicks/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Fifty Licks Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt;, for their legend-dairy (and non-dairy)
ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
