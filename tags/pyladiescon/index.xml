Perhaps you never gave a talk before, and unsure if speaking for you? Perhaps you want to give a talk, but don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re experienced enough? Perhaps you have a talk idea, but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to turn it into a proposal? Perhaps you tried submitting talks before, but always get rejected and feeling discouraged?</description></item></channel></rss>
